reviewtext I've used ear gels several products pleased comfort. currently use Aliph Jawbone. work well there's problem hearing callers however think Jawbone difficult get one hand definitely want add ear gels continue using ear loop. Using loop gels combination 2handed endeavor even frustrating hurry. continue use loop used gel alone felt like earpiece would stay securely ear. loop gel earpiece snug secure even harshest I drive Jeep take top off winds comfortable wear.

reviewtext use Aliph Jawbone surprise they're perfect matches other. eargels fit speaker nub Jawbone exactly secure find eargels fall occasionally. also expecting act like earplugs snugly fit ear canal case. However eagels fit quite comfortably. would imagine they're pretty good headset designed. They're nice soft molded fit ears would think they fit mine pretty well. They're little pieces plastic I'm sure else say them. current headset uncomfortable I'd say go ahead buy set these. They're expensive might find good solution!

reviewtext use Jawbone 2.First good get earpiece place one it stays well much comfortable basic ones come jawbone. However several things make eargels great. First stay earpiece well. easy knock eargel especially putting ear frustrating. one 3 sizes fit differently found odd. Luckily one use fits better others. Second positioning place ear takes effort every time put on. magnifies first issue. last bit bigger basic rubber comes jawbone makes jawbone stick little making little bit likely jawbone separate cheek talking. find person end says what times.

reviewtext ProsPairing easy. thing work usable entrylevel Bluetooth headset. Loved mechanism fits ear that's comfortable secure time. ConsYou pretty much get pay for. looks nice feels flimsy. plug charger in feels like fit putting wrong. big problem feels like symptom cheaply made product. The performance AX2 received thought defective sent back exchange. seemed like connection headset phone almost always plagued bad static connection dropped quite often people spoke using headset often complained could barely hear me. However replacement unit Amazon sent kudos return process customer service way behaved exactly way tells model is. In end returned bought justreleased Plantronics Discovery 665 AudioIQ Amazon sells this too bought mine Sprint. difference night day. course Plantronics also costs several times much darn well better perform. Overall I'd say AX2 okay deal buy Amazon's discounted price do go pay retail thing nearly worth dozens better models price point casual user thing. mean part does work  particularly well.

reviewtext Palm fits cover securely perfectly. cover snaps closed bit stiffly first week clicks shut easily securely. Light slim solid case takes dropping well. Front cover clearance Palm's screen impacted all. Two slots front cover hold standard SD cards. Looks like enough clearance cards press onto Palm's screen tested that. Recessed access top bottom connection points Palm provide protection without ever take Palm case. functional.

reviewtext case design awesome steer clear metallic version. scratches easily. I've got black version LOVE it. like case protects entire Palm TX. one corner TX extends beyond case ever drop it may jostled totally destroyed. cut outs give ample room work turning using cords memory cards stylus. There's even little cutout back speaker. case latch solid pop open. Inside there's soft felt lining slots 2 memory cards. use belt clip case fine price right too.
