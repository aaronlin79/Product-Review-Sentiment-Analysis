Although, nice pics phone email custom wallpaper & ringtones phone, I'm really thinking returning rude little punk. could, I'd give zero stars.(I'm 100% sure make difference since main problem appears Sony's software download them, cable appears made someone Sony oficial Sony Data cable pretty much sold Sony's website.)Update 6/4/2006:I given data cable Sony Ericsson z500a gift (turned 3rd party cable like product is). first, happy I'd able transfer pictures taken camera phone computer email friends back home...but installing everything, thing worked times nerve-rackingly slow pace. tons headaches messing that, contacted Sony's tech support. seem know figure problems well, could call get info send new cable. new cable (Sony Ericsson cable) seem work either, I've called several times now--each time speaking 2-3 reps.So, advice would bother data cable (third party Sony's) since neither work properly. third party cable product, tell Sony tech support help you, basically money spent cheap unofficial cable. enjoy Sony Ericsson z500a & watch anyone camera phone working data cable ideas next phone.

review/text: Kudos dude/dude-ette figured Jabra ear gels might improve bad, painful ineffective stock rubber covers provided Jawbone product. Jabra gels perfect solution Icon-Hero, they're heaps better original earbud-nonsense supplied bluetooth unit (which totally dig). Still, drama finding way "rig" $100 electronic device reputable manufacturer hurt ear cool. Aliph-Jawbone listening? know ears fit requirements different, I'm sayin'...really? Anyway, looking alternative problem(s) associated original, messed-up-a$$ earbuds, might already know gotta use one round earbuds like one unit new Jabra eargel fit it. Here's thing: depending size Jabra eargel use, may swap stock Jawbone ear bud.

review/text: reading reviews December (there 15-20 time), decided even though probably best Bluetooth Headset market, might best price. mostly good reviews time.So bought it. excited! loved over-the-ear thing 'cause hate things! Well, seemed good first - great functions, loved way fit rubber tail, extremely light.... actually started using - made adjustments rubber ear plug, could hear people end fine, problem always seemed complain getting bad feedback sounding like tunnel. always end taking Bluetooth using phone 5 minutes 'cause friends can't stand it.Oh well. guess moral lesson this... Bluetooth still fairly new technology lot room improvement, point way get really great Bluetooth headset pay big bucks ($75+) one latest greatest best technology. like can't afford that, probalby best waiting technology improves prices come down, because, yeah, got headset great price, since worthless, I'd better spending money something could actually use (like groceries - hehe).

Extremely lightweight, secure fit. easy forget light. soft spring easily fits ear secures it. hook type headsets, play side-to-side head movement. fits snugly ear normal movements feel loose unsecured. notice speaker piece ear hours, painful, little sore one size. generally keep headset day anyway, realized forgotten in.2. Incoming sound loud. in-ear design fit allows hear well. one headset I've used actually want full volume.3. lots ways connect conference calls. control switching headset handset headset, connecting one call buttons.4. blue talk light turns red battery low, giving visual warning.Not great:1. Lots static bluetooth connection. cellphone belt clipped left, use headset right ear. tend notice near wifi source, always. I've also noticed away wifi signals (like car). I've headset week, still trying figure 3' distance 30' BT device would much problem clear connection.2. volume loud, sound quality poor. Motorola H500 nearly loud, can't hear well noisy, sound quality much better. AX2 sounds like midrange frequencies boosted. may make voices easier hear, also sounds tinny unnatural.3. Build quality mediocre. plastic, dropped waist level onto parking lot surface. One volume buttons popped off, battery compartment half popped out, well plastic halves loosened. volume button. I'd heard others say unit breaks easily, believe might survived drop ear level.4. Headset tends echo, although know worse BT sets. Motorola echoed, quite much this. notice it, person call mention it.5. first day power on/off tone clearly audible. know happened, first day tone muted much listen closely hear unit power off.I still hunt ideal bluetooth set. try noise cancelling mics bone conduction technology next older mic technology represents leaves much desired.
