First stay earpiece well. easy knock eargel especially putting ear frustrating. one 3 sizes fit differently found odd. Luckily one use fits better others. Second positioning place ear takes effort every time put on. magnifies first issue. last bit bigger basic rubber comes jawbone makes jawbone stick little making little bit likely jawbone separate cheek talking. find person end says times. still better standard rubber pieces come jawbone. price think worth it. recommend finding way get eargel stay better half frustration go away. think reviewers ideas this.

Build quality mediocre. plastic dropped waist level onto parking lot surface. One volume buttons popped battery compartment half popped well plastic halves loosened. volume button.

reviewtext case appears identical ones sold Wireless Emporium AccessoryOne. also appears virtually identical widely lauded Smart Phone Experts P6 case although clear whether original P6 case snapdown interior flap behind two SD cards may stored. First things first. case thus likely similar cases mentioned definitely real leather. analytical chemist used reflection IR spectroscopy determine case including material wrapping clip actually polyurethanebased imitation leather. said case looks nice expecting real leather price range anyway. Edit three months daily use case showing significant wear corners making obvious actually imitation leather.I several concerns functionality case far happy it. areConcern 1 magnetic flap might come open easily snagged something. First two magnets pretty strong. Second receiving surface recessed bit flap stick much. Third pleasant surprise flap springs back closed especially beltit actually difficult force case remain open position. Concern 2 Treo 700wx might fall easily. case turns fairly snug short elastic strips sides. I'm yet sure looks like elastic might also enough give accomodate egrips. definitely like access naked Treo. Treo get knocked case still theoretical risk think much likely simply drop it. fairly easy retrieve 700 case without bumping anything want I'd bet true 680 model without protruding antenna. Concern 3 interior snaps might scratch Treo. snaps actually plastic faces quite flat. Whether insert phone screen facing yet noticed problem. Edit three months use phone facing inward time indeed scuff left speaker appears come snap. Despite still prefer keep phone facing in.Concern 4 magnets might cause data loss. Actually never concern mine heard others voice it. problem report. routinely handle electronics items near much stronger magnetic fields lab never problem. Credit cards another story however....Concern 5 magnets might get pressed screen crack it. front case flap actually feel like fairly rigid plastic sheets sewn inside magnets flat. flap closed thus several plies material phone outside world. case bulletproof feel like one adequate job protecting Treo without adding new risks due poor design. Concern 6 clip might come belt. problemit's stiff. stiff fact takes little practice easily slide belt. Also scratch belts like clampstyle belt clips although we'll see long imitation leather covering clip holds up....Concern 7 might like fixed nonrotating clip. funny thing generic box mine came sticker saying Premium Horizontal Fitted Pouch w Ratcheting Swivel Palm TREO 650 700w. Nopebut neither expecting one product description page. turns wore prior swivel case horizontal position time anyway case sits much closer body. harder remove case completely belt clip stiff getting easier practice. Concern 8 Poor access connections. easily access headphone jack whether screen facing out. Either orientation allows access volume buttons opening flap want listen MP3s. However way conveniently access 700wx's WMP PlayPause button reassign function side button. best reassign Q button accessible phone case least screen facing out. However cannot charge phone connect synch cable access ringer onoff switch case. hope helps. definitely best case needs inexpensive boot! Four five stars.

reviewtext HelloI scientist field MicrowaveRF circuits systems. considered several finally chose Jabra A210 along BT250 Jabra headset. review items together. things note1 swithcing intuitive BT250 hold power button n number seconds lights flash certain preordained sequence hold power button required sketchy appliances enter set mode pairing adapter headset might lost. A210 paired means stylus pressing depressed switch body unit. pairing affected power button. set headset adapter 8 hours talk time 240 hours standby time per manufacturer's claim even performs 80 reported claim wont mess around much power switch. comfortably use day come home night recharge set.2 Quality sent received signals. Please note jabra A210 pin put 3 settings. Setting 1 motorola phones Setting 3 phones Setting 2 feel discomfort setting 1 3. LG VX 6100 NONBLUETOOTH phone verizon. tested settings extensively calling friend. Thanks Guddu. tried setting 1 2 noticeable problems friend complained volume voice low clarity good.b could use button head set connect disconnect calls. must mention could receive friend's voice absolutely loud clear tones. problems alleviated used setting 3 adapter. fact started using setting 3 friend complained voice loud! werent issues related clarity.3 Range manufacturer claims range 10 meters 30 feet. time manual written objects wireless signal path adapter headset sound quality suffer. consider 2 trade offs every RF design. power b size. want smallest devices maximum power range. Well physics electronics sharply put us back places. want greater range need put signal great field strength. needs higher battery consumption high efficiency non linear amplifiers large antennas. Microstrip patch antennas generally used low profiles small size resonate particular frequency length correctly defined. design modifications length shortened gain suffers. Also thanks FCC strict limitations frequency bands available higher frequency shorter wave length thus smaller antenna consequently higher gain. FCC makes many RF devices work lower frequencies RF engineers would like operate at. Also due fear signal one device interferring devices FCC puts limits amount power device put out. Given considerations A210 BT250 required excellent power efficiency 8 hours talk time 240 hours stand time also small compact size small batteries small antennas provide range quite satisfactory. walked radius 10 feet even walls metal partitions etc signal strength affected. ever 10 feet signal much noise move closer adapter. honest happy range. dont think range 130 worth adapter headset 50 80. Period. 10 feet range cost like 50 both.So basically reviewed basic factors. However one major design flaw would like bring attention. head set adapter enter stand mode one minute nonusage. even middle call parties keep silent minute head set adapter stop communicating. call disconnected. either pull adapter jack cell phone put back press volume key cell phone basically thing cell phone able resume conversation bluetooth devices. ever voice operable. Meaning adapter headset enter stand mode conversation parties call silent even start talking adapter head set start communicating. extremely uncomfortable. blue tooth head set adapter kit paid 130 want absolute mobility reason come back adpater unless free will. Lastly recommendation people designed set. need incorporate greater features adapter head set. able handle voice data also music types audio information. means might need use efficient method modulation. Maybe using FSK constant envelope modulation deal military radar communication dont know modulation used blue tooth cannot include much information FSK signal. Try using QAM maybe high order QAM thing capable handling audio information. need change design new power amplifier high efficiency linear. Probably class E Class F feed forward Envelope elimination restoration Kahn Doherty principles. simple. need one time engineering development cost long term market domination mass production make it. buyers. rich techno geek business person constantly phone Go this. good. limited resources money buy simple wired hands free kit. fact times battery move get back within range long reliability wired handsfree kit. Update June 25th 2005 way lost one A210 recently purchased one more. tried one test recently. got adapter radio shack Part 274397 accepts 332 submini stereo plug plug A210 fits 18 mini stereo jack plug standard head phone jacks. Thus connected A210 adapter connected new Creative MuVo MP3 player. put BT250. worked!! could hear music blue tooth set up! music quality poor... blue tooth unit probably enough sampling rate speech able handle sudden faster changes amplitude phase frequency music signal. Nevertheless works. Kaushik.
