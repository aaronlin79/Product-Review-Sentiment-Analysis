product/title: Mobile Action MA730 Handset Manager - Bluetooth Data Suite
review/text: First of all, the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped. A week and a half later I received another email telling me that they are sorry, but they don't actually have any of these items, and if I received an email telling me it has shipped, it was a mistake.When I finally got my money back, I went through another company to buy the product and it won't work with my phone, even though it depicts that it will. I have sent numerous emails to the company - I can't actually find a phone number on their website - and I still have not gotten any kind of response. What kind of customer service is that? No one will help me with this problem. My advice - don't waste your money!

review/text: The price was right for this cable ($11.95+$4.94 S&H;) compared with Sony Ericssons offering ($25+). There are a few different prices on Amazon through the same company, MyNetDeals.com, so make sure you get the $11.95 one.So I popped the CD in, followed the 2 line .txt instruction file on the disk and...nothing happened?!? Well, my phone started to charge. If you have a similar problem you may try what I did.I had previously installed a variety of the S.E. downloadable software on my computer. It took me about 15 minutes of fumbling around, but I made my way to the Phone Monitor Options by opening the catcheventatl.exe in C:\Program Files\Sony Ericsson\Mobile\Mobile Phone Monitor. From the pop-up window you have to hit the Options button. There may be a better way to get here, but this is how I did it. Go to the COM Ports tab and enable all of the COM ports. It told me it wouldnt enable COM4 because of an IR conflict, but within a few seconds, my phone was recognized, presumably on one of the remaining ports. I may not have had this issue if I installed the software fresh with the cable, but I had previously been using the IR feature to transfer data. The cable is faster than IR, but not tremendously. The big benefit is you dont have to worry about losing line of site and messing up your download.Hope you have success.

review/text: Well, it technically does what it is supposed to do--that is, allows you to transfer files from your phone to your computer or vice versa. But, it is rude & puts up a fight to do so. The thing came with no instructions, so it took forever to install. Once installed, it creates a desktop icon which can't be removed or modified...because it's not actually a desktop icon (when I figure out what exactly this thing is, I'll post it) or in the registry at all. Actual transfer of files takes over the entire computer (don't have anything else running) and is slower than a floppy drive! I've found a ton of settings and such that the software changed without asking (rude in my book), so I'm probably going to have to re-install Windows to get everything back the way I like it. Although, it's nice to have the pics off my phone to email and have a custom wallpaper & ringtones on my phone, I'm really thinking of returning this rude little punk. If I could, I'd give it zero stars.(I'm not 100% sure that this will make a difference since the main problem appears to be Sony's software that you download from them, but the cable appears to be made by someone other than Sony and the oficial Sony Data cable is pretty much only sold through Sony's website.)Update on 6/4/2006:I was given a data cable for my Sony Ericsson z500a as a gift (turned out to be a 3rd party cable like this product is). At first, I was happy that I'd be able to transfer pictures taken with my camera phone to my computer to email to friends back home...but after installing everything, the thing only worked a few times at a nerve-rackingly slow pace. After tons of headaches messing with that, I contacted Sony's tech support. They don't seem to know how to figure out problems very well, and about all they could do on that call was get my info to send out a new cable. The new cable (Sony Ericsson cable) doesn't seem to work either, and I've called them several times now--each time speaking with 2-3 reps.So, my advice would be to not bother with the data cable (third party or Sony's) since neither will work properly. If you have a third party cable such as this product, don't tell Sony tech support because then they won't help you, so you're basically just out the money you spent on a cheap unofficial cable. Just enjoy your Sony Ericsson z500a & watch anyone who has a camera phone that has a working data cable for ideas for your next phone.

review/text: If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for.

review/text: I've gone through many different bluetooth headphones. This is the first pair I ever bought many many years ago. I'm wearing them right now. I've tried the S9's, S10's, Jabra Halo, Jabra Sport, Arctic Cooling. That doesn't even include the plain old jerk-buds.These look atrocious. My wife hates them. They are still my gold standard.I have a walk that kills BT reception every time on every headset. These only lose the signal for half a step. The Jabra Sport, by contrast, doesn't even work when it is set on the table in front of me. The Arctic Cooling headphones are my latest. They are more comfortable, but still lose the signal whenever I walk outside.Yes, I live next to a Cell Tower. So my situation is very stressful for a BT headphone or headset. The BT820s, old school, just work. Period.

I could not get any sound to come out when connected with my Sony Ericsson w600i in phone or Walkman mode, and people could not hear me when I called them. I tried every setting possible, read the instructional booklets for each device and the thing still wouldn't to anything when connected. I am guessing that this headset works fantastically with any Motorola device, but as far as I'm concerned this product is guilty of false advertising.

review/text: The Motorola StarTAC Hands Free Car kit is outstanding. The speaker audio is loud and clear and the microphone pick up crisp. I have had hands free on my previous car phones and it is the &quot;way to go&quot;. The kit is very inclusive and easy to install if you are comfortable with basic electronics and able to take the molding, etc, off your car in order to run the antenna coax, etc. (External antenna is not included but you really need to get one for maximum performance) Anyone who has installed a Ham or CB radio will be right at home. The mounting of the holder for the StarTAC cell phone itself may need some modification or you may want to make a bracket in order to get a neat installation.I would suggest that you mount it as high as possible in order to keep it as close to your driving line of sight for safety concerns. Mine worked flawlessly after a 2-3 hour install in a Ford F-150. Will be mounting one in our Lincoln TC soon. Also suggest that you mount the hands free microphone near the center of the car (near the rear view mirror or center it on the dash) so that a passenger can be heard should they speak. A must have.

review/text: If you have had an issue with the Jawbone headset staying in your ear, purchase these babies and pick out the one that works best in your ear. Then you can attach it to your Jawbone one of two ways. First is the easiest, take off the twist ear piece and place the Jabra EarGel on. Put it on your ear and find the best position for you. Then place a couple of small (super tiny) drops of super glue on the EarGel and the Jawbone. Let it setup overnight and presto! You have a great bluetooth that stays in place. The other is to take one of the extra ear buds and take it apart and keep the ring. Place that ring inside the EarGel and glue it into place. Keep in mind you must have the correct position so when you put it on that it has the perfect fit once it is twisted.

I bought the Jabra Clear Gels from 'Radio Snack' for under $5 and replaced the factory bud with this empty plastic ring on the jawbone, then pressed the gel piece over the ring and speaker hole to make a nice factory-like fit to the jawbone and a custom fit to my large ear canal. There was no extreme stretching of the Gel over the thin ring. The new Gel with the factory locking ring holds itself securely in my ear and the sound quality is much improved over the loose fitting factory buds.

It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece.

Does it go up, down, sideways, or at a slant to follow the "dip" my ear has just in front of the hole. And since I can't figure that out, & the fact even the small one is too big, it keeps slipping out of my ear. Thank goodness for the loop, or I'd have lost it long ago. Also, it becomes very irritating to the ridges in my ear & I usually have to take it off. I wish they still had the gels that came with the bluetooth. That one was really comfortable.

They also caused my Jawbone Prime to protrude far enough so that the front part no longer touched my face (which is required for their noise reduction circuitry to work). I threw these away and am now using the stock earbud with the ear hook.These are designed for people with a certain ear shape. If your ears don't conform to this shape (which is likely the case for many people), these will be useless.

review/text: I purchased this product after searching for ways to make Jawbone fit better. It worked!! Now my Jawbone fits perfectly, not popping/falling out of my ear. Also noticed I didn't need the volume as loud with audio directed into the ear canal. The Jawbone rests perfectly against my jaw for crystal clear conversations. It's also not necessary to keep the earpiece in the ear at all times while in standby. The eargels make the headset easy to find in your pocket/purse and put in the ear when receiving a call. I do recommend washing the earbuds with antibacterial soap and water prior to use then occasionally to reduce ear tenderness. Make sure to dry it well before putting it back on your bluetooth headset or other device.

review/text: These EarGels make using my Jawbone I for long periods of time much more comfortable. I just put the EarGel over the existing ear button and it fits just right in my ear. No need to push and shove to get it seated and tight. Makes for a better drive when I am not always pushing in on the Jawbone to make sure it stays put. Great addition to any bluetooth earpiece that it will fit.

review/text: Ladies and Gentlemen..... I bought this product to go with my jawbone 2. and it is GREAT!! With this product I am able to take off the loop that comes with my jawbone and wear it all day without any problems. I actually have to turn the sound down when I wear it because it is loud. It looks so much better without the ear loop. I found the best way to figure out which size to use is to try the ear gels in your ear first until you find the right one. Be careful putting the ear gel over the Jawbone ear piece ( you dont want to tear it). There is a chance that these ear gels wont fit your ear but for the price they cost it is worth the gamble. If it fits you'll find a new level of comfort, sound quality and not to mention it looks a lot better to get rid of the ear loop.

review/text: These EarGels are the best solution bar-none to fix the comfort issue with the Aliph Jawbone 2. They make it possible to leave the jawbone in place for extreme durations. My only concern now is that my jawbone is so comfy and fixed it so well with no weight that I might fall asleep on it or take a sower with it on! To mod this onto the jawbone I simply removed the earbud O-ring and found the right size eargel for my ear. (Large in this case) then got some super glue to paint around where the O-ring attached on the jawbone, then simply placed the jawbone inside the eargel that I fitted on my ear. Left it in my ear for a few hours to dry and done. (Course I kept wearing it even after those hours were up) :)

review/text: These eargels work with the Aliph The New Jawbone, or Jawbone 2, or the slim jawbone. I found that the earbuds provided from Aliph did not suit my ear. It was not secure even with the earloop attached. These did the trick. It was a gamble at first since i found barely any reviews on such a product with its compatibility with the New Jawbone, but it worked out for the best. These are not made for the jawbone so you are relying on its snug fit to stay in place. I removed the original eargel and replaced these onto the unit. It is snug enough for me to use without the earloop. Also its design makes the eargel stay in place in your ear. It may be tricky to fit in your ear at first but in time you'll get the feel for it. It fits my ear perfectly with the largest size. As a bonus you get multiple sizes. This is an excellent solution for those that don't have the right ear for the original gels provided for the New Jawbone.On another note it attracts dust because it has the silicon feel. Washing with water fixes it right up.This review is based upon purchase through Amazon and ownership for more than half a year.

Of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound, but they're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping.The only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use.

review/text: Kudos to the dude/dude-ette who figured out that the Jabra ear gels might improve the bad, painful and ineffective stock rubber covers provided with your Jawbone product. The Jabra gels aren't a perfect solution for my Icon-Hero, but they're heaps better than the original earbud-nonsense supplied with the bluetooth unit (which I totally dig). Still, the drama of finding a way to "rig" a $100 electronic device from a reputable manufacturer so that it doesn't hurt your ear is not cool. Aliph-Jawbone are you listening? I know that all ears and fit requirements are different, but I'm just sayin'...really? Anyway, if you've been looking for an alternative to the problem(s) associated with the original, messed-up-a$$ earbuds, you might already know that you gotta use one of the round earbuds like the one on the unit when it was new so that the Jabra eargel can fit over it. Here's the thing: depending on which size Jabra eargel you use, you may have to swap out that stock Jawbone ear bud. I.E. - the large Jabra gel doesn't fit over the smallest, Jawbone ear bud. So be prepared to play with those combinations a bit as well as figuring out the right Jabra gel to get your best fit. Once you work that out, give it a chance as you and your ear may need a moment to adjust to how it feels. The volume improvement is nice too. Good luck.

review/text: If you have trouble getting your Jawbone to fit like I did, these may be a good solution for you. The largest one worked great for me. I wear it without the ear loop now. However, you can do a number of different combination with/without earloop and with/without the original ear buds attached to achieve your perfect fit. The other nice thing is that these sit in your ear and blocks out more outside noise so you can actually hear better. I found myself turning the volume down a bit after using these.

Unfortunately, contradictory to what the other reviewer indicated, the ear gels did not even come close to fitting over the ear piece on the Jawbone, and thus were pretty much useless to me. In fact, one of the gels even split open as I was trying to make it fit over the earpiece on the Jawbone. Maybe it's because I have smaller ear, and I had to use the smallest one, but it totally didn't work for me. Oh well, at least they weren't too expensive.

review/text: I've used these ear gels on several products and have been very pleased with their comfort. I currently use them to on my Aliph Jawbone. They work well and there's no problem with hearing callers; however, if you think the Jawbone is difficult to get on with one hand you definitely don't want to add the ear gels and continue using the ear loop. Using the loop and gels in combination is a 2-handed endeavor and even then can be frustrating when you're in a hurry. I continue to use the loop because when I used the gel alone, I felt like the earpiece would not stay in securely in my ear. With the loop and the gel, the earpiece is snug and secure, even in the harshest (I drive a Jeep and take the top off) winds; and is comfortable to wear.

The eargels fit over the speaker nub on the Jawbone it's not exactly secure and I find the eargels fall off occasionally. I was also expecting these to act more like earplugs, that snugly fit in your ear canal but that isn't the case. However, the eagels do fit quite comfortably. I would imagine they're pretty good on the headset for which they were designed. They're nice and soft and molded to fit most ears, I would think (they fit mine pretty well). They're just little pieces of plastic so I'm not sure what else to say about them. If you're current headset is uncomfortable, I'd say go ahead and buy a set of these. They're not very expensive and you might find a good solution!

review/text: I use these with my Jawbone 2.First the good: once you get the earpiece in place with one of these on it, it stays in well and is much more comfortable than the basic ones that come with the jawbone. However, there are several things that don't make these eargels great. First, they don't stay on the earpiece very well. It is very easy to knock off the eargel, especially while putting it in your ear which can be very frustrating. Each one of the 3 sizes fit differently too which I found very odd. Luckily the one I use fits better than the others. Second, positioning it in place in your ear takes some effort each and every time you put it on. This magnifies the first issue. And last, because these are a bit bigger than the basic rubber that comes with the jawbone it makes the jawbone stick out a little further making it a little bit more likely for the jawbone to separate from your cheek while talking. You'll find this out when the person on the other end says "what?" a few times.All in all these are still better than the standard rubber pieces that come with the jawbone. And for the price I think it is worth it. I recommend finding a way to get the eargel to stay on better and then half the frustration will go away. I think some other reviewers have ideas for how to do this.

review/text: Super fast delivery. The last ear loop on my Jawbone had worn out. The large ear gel fit over the Jawbone earbud and, with a little superglue, stays there. It fits in my ear without using any loops. After a full day, the ear is a little tender, but it is getting better the more I use it. I would highly recommend the ear gels for anyone with a Jawbone. Improves sound and the fit of the sensor with the jaw.

review/text: Product arrived much quicker than expected. I have a Jawbone 2 bluetooth earpiece, and I keep breaking the ear-loop, and I could not find replacement parts. Not wanting to give up my Jawbone (and rather not buy a new one) I thought I would first give the Jabra EarGels a try... and I'm glad I did! My earpiece not only stays in place without the ear-loop, it just functions better. I CANNOT shake it off my head. It actually isolates the sound better into my ear. With 6 provided (3 left and 3 right) finding the perfect fit was easy (you will need to use the original ear cushion in addition to the EarGel for two of the EarGels to fit best with the earpiece) - all and all... a five-star product, and company!

review/text: Bought these for my Aleph Jawbone IPROS: Fit right on, stays snug. Do not have to use the ear loop any more. Cheap. Isolates sound from background noise better than stock Jawbone earpieces.CONS: Ocassionally comes the headset when not in use or when I take it off my ear. Could not find one that fit my ear perfectly.BOTTOM LINE: A no-brainer upgrade for Jawbone users. Not a perfect solution but much better than what came with the Jawbone and its too cheap to not give it a try.

review/text: I have a motorola H695 bluetooth which I managed to adapt to use with the eargels, what a difference! I can hear better, I threw out the ear loop which I no longer need at all. The earpiece stays in very well. I use a large one with the bluetooth and I used the medium ones for my earphones which cuts out more of the background noise so I need less volume. The come with a set of three sizes sm med lg for both ears so you get 6 all together.

review/text: I have been using in-ear bluetooth devices for a couple of years. My wife and daughter (of the small ear canal clan) had opted for over the ear designs because of fit and comfort issue. As it turned out, neither of them used their ear buds because of the loose/insecure fit and feel of the ear hanger design. The Jabra gels resolved that problem by 'sizing down' to match their diminutive ears . . . . It would be nice if you could order by specific size (s-m-l)and side (l-r) rather than getting the 'variety pack'.

review/text: They look cheep and feel cheep and well.. they are cheep but they don't work which is the bottom line. Fitting them onto the jawbone does not lock into place so the ear piece you just spent over a 100bucks for falls out of your ear! It's not worth it since Jawbone gives you five ear buds that lock onto the Jawbone, which fit your snugly in your ear. They also give you a left ear or a right ear bar that lets you choose which works for you. So this product fails and had I'd seen them in person I wouldn't have spent my money on them.

review/text: I bought these Jabra Eargels from another retailer, because I thought they had the colored ones, which are supposedly more durable than their clear counterparts. Well, they did not have the colored ones, but the clear ones I received from them were horrible junk. I tried the pieces on before fitting them with headphones and the medium and large pieces fit great in my ear, I thought I was really going to like this product! I didn't consider to think that putting in the somewhat oversized earbud driver was going to stretch the entire piece. It took a lot of struggle to even get the earbud in in the first place, I had to let them warm up so that the material was at least somewhat stretchy first. I eventually got the earbuds to stay, and tried to fit them in my ear. Well, they wouldn't. They were stretched to far to fit in my ear AT ALL, it was like trying to force a square peg into a round hole.So I let them sit for a while and went to do something else, I come back and decide they're not for me(after trying all sizes), and when I'm packing them back up, I notice that the large size has a giant split right down the middle on both sides, leaving a tiny 3mm strip of material that hasn't torn through. I returned them, and who would blame me? See the title, this product is complete garbage.

review/text: I'm giving these a 3 star rating because despite the three different sizes, I never felt as if they gave a good fit. They are soft, but still contributed to some fatigue after wearing for more than an hour. Additionally, I bought these ear gels to replace the factory ear bud on the Jawbone 2. I never got a good fit and seal, and the JB2 felt unstable while wearing the ear gels. Also, they distorted the angle for the JB2, which needs to have a contact point along to jawbone to work properly. I eventually went back to the factory ear bud, which is less comfortable, but more functional.

review/text: I purchased these EarGels for my Jawbone (JB) BlueTooth (BT) headset as most people I have spoken with swear by them. The ear loop provided by JB breaks when I put the BT device in my pocket and the plastic ear piece gets very uncomfortable after wearing it a short period of time.I took the plastic ear piece off of the JB only to discover that the hole in the EarGels are too big. Therefore the JB comes off quite easily.I put the most round plastic ear piece that comes with the JB back on the JB (there are different shapes- some round, some pointed to fit your ear better) as the pointy ear piece will obviously not fit well on the EarGel. This worked ok but now the EarGel would fall out of my ear with the JB attached. This same thing happened no matter what size EarGel I used. Not good either.After monkeying around with this for some time (and splitting one of the EarGels down the side), I have come to this conclusion. Most people will probably have to wear the ear loop with the EarGels as the EarGels are not really meant to be worn alone and/or cannot hold the JB headset on its own. The EarGels definitely feel much better than the hard plastic ear pieces that JB gives you. For the price of the JB, they ought to partner with Jabra and incorporate the EarGels with the JB headset.Bottom line, the EarGels are much better than what you get from the BT makers but are not the end solution for most people.

review/text: If you take the ear bud off the Jawbone and try to attach the Jabra Eargels, they won't stay on very well. Instead, notice that the Jawbone comes with two round earbuds that appear to be identical. Tear the rubber shroud off one of them to expose the round plastic piece inside of it. Take this plastic piece and lock it onto the Jawbone (read user's manual). The Eargels will slip over this piece and hold quite firmly to the headset. Notice also that the Eargels have a square notch on the inside. Point the notch toward the back of the Jawbone. This will align the piece properly with the ear.The Eargels allow the Jawbone to be securely held in the ear without the annoyingly difficult earloop, but cause a little discomfort in my ear because I have to use the larger pieces. With the earloop, I can use the smallest piece and the Eargels are very comfortable.

review/text: I recently purchased a Jawbone bluetooth headset. Works great. Ear fit was a little loose and I found myself pushing it more into my ear to hear better. Having seen the suggestions and other reviews to use the Jabra Clear Ear Gels, I decided to try some. Got them yesterday and couldn't get them to fit. Read some more reviews this morning and saw that you have to play with them a bit. So I did. I found out that the set I got had a few different sizes BUT all of them except 1 were formed for use in the right hand ear! I have poor hearing in my right ear so usually use my left for phone conversations. I was able to use the one for the left ear and get it to fit pretty well. I don't know if it is the best fit cause I couldn't compare any other size. I did remove the 1/4-turn ear piece that came with the Jawbone and stuck the Jabra directly onto the stem. After removing the ear loop, it seems that the modified Jawbone will stay in my ear and I can remove it a certain way so that it doesn't slip off. If I use the earloop, the Jabra ear gel slips off when taking it off my ear. Is comfortable but I haven't used it for a long time yet.

Sometimes they do fall off so you have to be very careful with them.Unfortunately these eargels reviewed here are not them. You want these: EarGels (MiniGels) for Jabra BT250, BT250v, BT500, BT2020, C220s, C250, GN6210 are not them. They are only available from Jabra [...]

review/text: I recently purchased a Aliph Jawbone BT headset. #1 BT Headset on the market IMHO. I wasn't wild about the piece that goes around your ear however. I never have been. So I picked up a pack of the Jabra EarGels. Best decision of my life. I pulled the plastic ring that snaps onto the Jawbone out of one of the earpieces that comes with it and stuck it inside the EarGel. Snapped it onto the Jawbone, and bingo. Instant comfort. Can't go wrong. Great product!

review/text: Bought these based on a recommendation from another site for a badly shaped earplug for a headphone I bought. The three sets (sizes) are really nice in that it allows some variety. The shape of these really funnel the sound into your ear, which is nice and helps with outside sound. The fit in the ear means that it will hold most headsets in your ear comfortably without a hook or other method from the headset.The nodule on the bottom fits over most earpiece sized rods - I've easily put it over one as big as a in-ear headphone jack and as small as the rod on my LG headset from work (which was far too small for every other one I found).

review/text: All I have read about these was pretty much true. You can remove the rubber piece and press these over the part that it was attached to and they will stay, but they do come out with a little tug. A fine line of rubber cement will fix that though, and it peels off if necessary. But the great thing is that they will hold the Jabra in your ear without the ear loop. And that's huge, especially for someone like me with really weird shaped ears that nothing else [except an over the head headset] seemed to work. All in all worth the cost easily. I just wish you could order multiple pieces in one size only. If I lose the 1 that fist my ear I have to buy a 6 pack again just to get the one that I need.

When it's in my ear, I can jump up and down (not that there's a usual reason to) and it doesn't come off. I'm using the largest size for the right side. Just don't keep it in the car when it's hot outside, the rubber might get a little soft and come off the Jawbone. let it cool and it's back to normal.

No mater which size earloop I tried, the Jawbone would flap against the side of my face as I walked. As a result, the 'noise assassin' sensor wouldn't touch my face, mitigating the benefit it should have had.Pros:+Jawbone now fits securely in my ear, even without the ear loop+Incredibly comfortable+Sound seems 'clearer' now that the speaker fits snugger in my ear and the noise assassin sensor touches my face.Cons:+The silicon isn't perfectly clear, and the yellowish tinge makes them look dirty+Much larger than I thought they would be - they're quite conspicuous.

Oh and once you get them (they come in a package of three for three different ear sizes, small, medium and large) you can super glue it on to your jawbone for a little more stability because for the jawbone the eargel can be a little loose. oh and its much louder then the stock ear adapter deal that comes with the jawbone. for me it was too loud with my krazer cell phone. I had the volume setting for as low as it would go and it was still blasting my ear drum. I ended up wodding up a piece of paper and sticking in there to baffle the volume. works near perfect now..

review/text: This device works great! The speaker is hidden under the dash and it still sounds perfect. The microphone does not have any feedback and picks up anyone's voice anywhere in the car. The external antanne (supported but not included) is great as the typical cell phone reception in my area is weak. I also like the small personal handset for private conversations. I did my own installation but would recommend hiring it done unless you have done something like this before (tapping into the fuse box, mounting hardware in a car, pulling wires under the dash). A reasonable installation charge would be between $50 and $100(it's not easy). I had to purchase an additional "post" to mount the cradle to as I could not find a suitable place to use the mount provided with the kit. This is a great unit and looks very professional when installed. Only problem is after using mine, everyone else in my family wants one!

product/title: Nokia Complete Hands-Free Car Kit with Audio Handset for Nokia Phones
review/text: This is one product that you'll wonder how you survived without it. It is very well integrated with the phone. Has antenna jack in cradle for external antenna (really needed in my area), automatic charger when you put the phone in the cradle, volume control on phone when talking is adjustable with the up and down buttons on phone, can control your car stereo to turn it off when phone in use, handset for private conversations.Note: 1) unless you are very technical, I would get a professional install -- f you want the phone to control the stereo, you'll probably pay extra because of extra contact relay required by most car stereo receivers. 3) For my cars (Chevy Tahoe and Chevy Silvarado Pickup) I had to buy an extra bracket to attach the cradle to the dash without drilling holes in the dash -- it attaches behind one of the seams in the dash. That costs ~20 more but is worth it so you don't have screw holes in the dash. 4) To control the car sterio, most receivers will need a contact relay (12V 30A, SPDT) to shut the receiver off and on. I wish that Nokia would just supply that part ... because it was hard to find (Radio Shack doesn't sell that particular part).I would definitely recommend this hands-free unit. The only thing bad about it was that the Nokia 5165 phone was basically free for me but the hands-free unit cost alot more ...

I often hold conference calls in my car on the way into the office. When travelling with the family, we often call the grandparents because it is the one place where everyone can join in the call at once. And the car kit is almost invisible with all but the cradle hidden behind the dashboard panels. The cradle is strong and sturdy, and, with the phone attached, does not look out of place next to the steering wheel. Combined with Nokia's quick dial features, the car kit makes using a phone in the car relatively safe.

review/text: This product was delivered by provider on time and the quality is better the original I bought directly from my cell phone provider and way cheaper! The only down side is that the cord is short so it is difficult to talk on the phone while it's charging (unless you are hands free).

review/text: I bought 2 of these and a RAZR battery from EFORCE CITY throught AMAZON assuming that Amazon would enforce some truth in advertising. Clearly all 3 products are china knockoffs according to the counterfit guide that one finds on other motorola product pages, but conveniently left off this one. I wrote eforce to compalin (dont bother calling!) and they insisted that all of their products came straight from Motorola!The chargers work fine, so for the price, I got what I paid for. The battery however (also clearly a knockoff) held less of a charge than the one it was replacing. I asked for a replacement(OEM as advertised this time Please!) and another knockoff was sent. Im disappointed in AMAZON for this. I was told to return anything I was unhappy with. Ill lose out on shipping both ways.one star because it worked, and they lied.Motorola Counterfeit Identification Guidebook: Motorola, Inc.

review/text: The car charger I ordered and got works great with my phone, but when I got it, it didn't look like the one the seller had pictured. He said it was on OEM. The one I received just had a small blue dot that lit up. The charger does look like it would be an OEM. I read from one seller that the one with the small blue dot was the newer model but I just checked the Motorola site and the one with the all blue glowing top is still the one they show. Reading a review by another buyer on another sellers site I found he had the same problem I did. So you may get the charger that is actually pictured and you may not depending on the seller. (Charger works great the reason for the 4stars and not 5stars is the charger did not look like the one pictured. If you really want what is pictured you may want to ask the seller if it is the one pictured, if you don't care what it looks like and just want one that works good then you can just order it)

review/text: It's cheap, eforcity delivers quickly, however, may not actually be OEM. All of the OEM chargers I've seen (model number SYN0847) has glowing stylized "M" motorola logo. This item, however, does not; it only has a small blue led underneath the "M" that glows when it's plugged in. All of the other labeling on the charger looks authentic Motorola. Maybe a really good knockoff? Anyway, does the job just fine (see title), and, again, it beats paying $20 at cingular.

review/text: This is NOT a real Motorola product, the M logo which is supposed to be illuminated from behind is not, there is a little blue LED below the logo - not even close to the real thing. Naturally I am leary of using this to charge my new MOTORIZR Z6tv (Verizon) as I don't want to toast my battery - I tried it on my old Razor phone as a guiny pig and it seemed to work (no smoke came out of it) but i won't use it on my new phone unless I have some kind of emergency and have to.

review/text: Interesting shape and blue light that glows when this unit is plugged into the cigarette lighter. Can't believe that I've paid 5x as much for off brand car chargers in the past. Some have come apart, some have stopped working after shorting out. This Motorola charger feels like a quality piece and appears to be one that will last. Have no idea why anyone would buy an off brand when you can have legendary Motorola quality with a cool looking shape/light. Can't think of one thing that would improve this charger. The price is the best part!! Highly recommend!

review/text: I bought this to recharge my phone, garmin, etc. It looks like the authentic Motorola recharger, but it won't recharge anything. Sure, it keeps the device working, almost, your device will run out of power eventually on this recharger, but slowly. However, I figured it would recharge the Garmin, etc, during use like my other rechargers did. I thought perhaps the LED light was using up too much power. I dismantled the thing after a great deal of effort and injury, and knocked out the light. It will now charge my Garmin very well. I don't recommend this product.

review/text: I bought this charger for only a couple of bucks and it works like a charm. I don't expect it last forever so i purchased a couple of back-ups just in case. Each one of these Adapters failed after a couple months use, even light use. I would skip this one and seek another way to charge such as an using an inverter and home plug in charger. This year I switched to an iPhone.

review/text: I have been looking for this adapter for some time now and found it at Amazon.com. The price is great, arrived before schedule, in new condition but did not work in my car. Everything fit properly but it would not charge my phone - I did not notice an illuminated LED which would indicate power input. In all fairness, my cigarette lighter may be on the brink and therefore not transferring current/voltage; I doubt it though. I had already thrown away the packaging so I couldn't return it so now I'm stuck with it.Maybe once I insert it into another vehicle, it may work. For now, this is it.

review/text: Love phone. Sleak design and not over burden with bells and whistles. However, Amazon and Cingular (AT&T) need to better coordinate the option of extending your Cingular contract with purchase of new phone from Amazon. Cingular over charged me $59.99 a month for an additional new plan....instead of extending my "family plan" contract for 24 months. Cingular customer service was terrible, Amazon on the otherhand was great. It took a day or two but they gave me a special Cingular number and my problem was solved. A great deal on a new phone but watch your phone bill closely.

The cover fits like a glove and keeps my phone from sliding around and helps absorb the daily bumps my phone gets.The cover is well worth the money.The only problem is that the hole for the SD card door is not larger enough to allow you to open the door and take out the SD card without taking the cover off or you have to take a razor blade and enlarge the cell phone cover opening.

You either have to remember where they are, or use a fine blade to cut out the holes. Matte black. Will offer some protection against scratches. It does fit the qwerty keyboard nicely, no obstruction of any of these keys. Also no obstruction of the camera lens. Can't open the card slot-cut out too small.

product/title: Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset (Pumpkin Orange) [Motorola Retail Packaging]
review/text: Bluetooth cell phone headsets are really a subjective choice. Some love them and others hate them, and some models seem to fit one person's ear (and lifestyle) better than another.That being said, this reviewer will try to offer an (overdue) opinion on what has turned out to be a pretty good choice in a well-made Bluetooth cell phone headset.When I first looked at the Motorola H500, it's price tag was in the $100 range, so it was easy to pass on in favor of wired headsets. But with the recent price drops, this unit is not only worth considering, it's now even lower priced than some of the better wired units that were former favorites. Considering that so many states and localities have laws against cell phone use while driving, this can be an excellent communication tool if used carefully and safely.There are many brands and model out there to choose from, but the Motorola H500 is well worth consideration, especially in light of its excellent pricing. Once adjusted and positioned correctly to the ear, its overall sound quality has turned out to be excellent. Had held off on making a decision between brands and models mostly because I wear glasses, but after a bit of retail store test driving for fit and sound, found (like other reviewers) that this headset seems to settle easily to my ear and just seems to fit properly.One way of looking at how well a Bluetooth cell phone headset functions would perhaps be to rate its use during everyday tasks or activities, so here are a few of those, along with my personal findings.- Driving: excellent, quite functional, 5-stars.- Walking: excellent, 5-stars.- Cycling: excellent, low wind noise, 5-stars.- Running: OK, 4-stars (felt like it might fall off).- Computing: excellent, 5-stars.- Sleeping: decent, 4-stars... hey, just joking here!Don't want to go on a rant about driving while using a cell phone, but if you take the time to read your phone's manual along with the one for the Motorola H500, you'll find that you can use it with voice activated functions, so that you don't need to fool with cell phone dialing when driving. Just program your phone, say your party's name into the Bluetooth device and you'll be automatically connected.Color selections - something for everyone:-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Silver-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Black-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Pink-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Orange-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Teal BluePros:- Overall good sound quality, very little static.- Comfortable to wear/use, has an ergonomic ear hook.- Clean, streamlined design.- Good range, better than some others.- Bluetooth 1.2 means less interference & faster connections.- Inexpensive, reasonably priced.- About 8 hours talk time and 200 hours standby time on a charge.Cons:- Ringtone alerts, but that's a personal thing.- Small volume controls.Is this Motorola headset the newest, latest and greatest? Nope. If you want that, check out the newJawbone II Bluetooth Headsetby Aliph, but then check out the price on that unit and compare the features.Summary:The Motorola H500 is an inexpensive Bluetooth cell phone headsets, offering good sound quality, nice ergonomics, and better-than-average range. It's an excellent communication device, adding to driving safety if used carefully. If you're looking for a good Bluetooth headset at a reasonable price, it's well worth considering.Update:For those who privately asked, my H500 didn't come in a box. It came in a ziplock-style bag that was marked "bulk" on the label. It contained the H500 headset, AC charger, user guides and a "Motomanual." From all appearances it was brand new.

review/text: I got this earpiece after my $100 one broke with minimal usage. I only use it to call my friends long distance once a week or so. It does it's job well and the sound is good. My friends never really complain about the noise or sound while I am using it. I will say that it is annoying since you don't know if it is "on" or "off". When you try to call sometimes it will automatically dial the last number your cell phone has and it might not be the person you want to call. It also has a tendency to easily be turned on and I have more then one occassion called my brother a few times with it in my purse. That is just with it accidently having the button on the earpiece pushed and as I said before, it will automatically dial the last number it has on the cellphone. It does not "sit" inside the ear, but hangs from your ear. I have not had too much problems with that, but if you like to have the thing in the ear then this isn't the one for you. The color is nice and the price was really good considering how much they use to go for. If anything happens to this one, it won't hurt my wallet like my $100 one did.

review/text: This is a fabulous device. It is wonderful when it works properly, and it is frustrating when it does not. I have used this product for almost a year now. It comes with 2 of the rubber pieces. I have now lost both of the pieces. a 2 foot drop to the wood floor caused an inner piece of the speaker to fall off.The device comes with a neckband so you can hang onto it, except while wearing it thus, the rubber piece quite often falls off. I have picked up this little piece of rubber that is supposed to go into my ear, off of numerous places. Once it falls if you are not somewhere with some cleanser, you really don't want to put it back -into- your ear again.It is a great device, but wonderfully frustrating as well. It is extremely light, makes for a lot of cool comments, and is a pleasure to use. I had no problem pairing it with 4 different phones and my laptop. It sounds good in the wind, and doesn't give a headache when you wear it for long periods of time. I could put it on in the a.m. and forget it's even there all day. Volume lower button has redial, so you end up having to raise volume after redialing.It takes some getting used to in order to put it into your ear. I suggest putting middle finger on top corner of the USB input, index on the rubber tip, and thumb on the mike end. I would recommend getting a pouch or holster to keep it safe when not in use.Would I buy it again? ProbablyWould I recommend it to others? If you want something cool and interesting, this is it.

review/text: Overall, my experience with this headset is positive. The sound is completely missing low frequencies, but you get used to that and voice clarity does not suffer.Fit is very comfortable, once you rotate the rubber stub to just the right angle (different angles for different ears). I've found that 2 o'clock direction of the stub, with headset pointing at 6, works best for me.I had to exchange the first headset I'd received from Amazon, because it would constantly disconnect, but replacement arrived within a couple of days, so the whole process was very smooth and painless.

review/text: This was my first attempt with a Bluetooth headset and I came away with the "just not right for me" impression. The AX2 is very small, but sound quality is generally good, with one exception. While I could hear callers just fine, it was next to impossible for me to hear the verbal commands from the phone. I also had a hard time operating the volume buttons. The only way to change volume was to take the headset from the ear. Overall, not a bad headset, just was not the one for me.

review/text: For those who wear glasses, this is the best!(Try to avoid ANY headset with hooks if you wear glasses no matter what other people say, IT WILL NO FIT and HURT your ears)For those who don't wear glasses, it is 4 out of 5 stars due to the fact that the sound quality is not as good as Samsung's WEP200. (not sure about other "hookless" headset)Battery Life, full charge, at least 4+ hours continuous talk time (I tested it personally)It weights like nothing to your ear.I had hard time to fit WEP200 on my ear, but AX2 is a snuggle fit. For half the price of WEP200, I will buy AX2.If you outside of the network and have no reception, the headset will do a "beep beep" signal for you, it will keep doing it until your phone get back the reception. Some people found it annoying, some people think this is a useful feature.Pro: Cheap, Tight Fit, VERY Light weight, BEST for people who wear glasses.Con: Okay sound quality, very loud wind noise @ outdoor (on the listener side).One more notice, for people who are going to get it, PLEASE read the instruction included carefully before you try to wear it. That plastic sticking out DOES NOT GOES INTO YOUR EAR CANAL. It sits within the grove inside of the external ear to secure the ear piece. So don't poke yourself to deaf with that.

review/text: I absolutely ADORE this headset. It fits snugly in your ear without being uncomfortable, stays in place, sounds great, battery life is fine for normal use all day long. It took the tiniest bit of work to figure out the thingy that curls up inside your ear. Although it looks like it would be extremely uncomfortable, you can't even feel it in there. There's nothing to wrap around the outside of your ear, so it doesn't bind and it doesn't interfere with glasses or sunglasses. It's so light it just floats there.So why 3 stars? My first one, the Bluespoon AX, lasted about a month then overheated while charging and wouldn't stay on anymore. But, I loved it SOOOOOO much, I went out and bought a second one, this time the AX2. It lasted about 2 weeks and did exactly the same thing.Why, oh why, did they finally make a headset that truly fits in my life, and make it so poorly that it won't keep working??????

review/text: I've had my AX2 now for about two weeks. So far, I really like it for it's size and weight. It's small enough so that I don't look like the Borg (Star Trek) when wearing it, and I don't feel any weight on my ear. I got used to the "antenna" used to hold it in place almost immediately. But unfortunately, the sound quality could be better. The speaker inside the earpiece delivers a lot of treble with little bass. Inside this seems to be okay, but outside I've had to ask my girlfriend to repeat statements a lot. If you plan to use the AX2 indoors, I'd definitely recommend it. But if you're looking for a bluetooth headset for outdoors, I might consider looking at other brands with better overall sound quality.

review/text: Don't let the picture fool you, this headset does not have an weird space age antenna. It is actually a really cool device to keep the headset in your ear without having the big bulky over the ear rubber piece that is supposedly one size fits all. The AX2's funny looking earpiece is ajustable and can be cut to fit almost any ear. As far as the quality, are their better headsets out there... Yes, but are there better headsets out there for the money, I don't think so. I put a strong buy on this BT headset.

Sound quality is excellent and it is the only one I can effectively use in the car on the highway, others are just not loud enough. A tip I would offer is to not leave it in your car, the cold weather killed the battery and not I am left with a, very light, paper weight. Replacement batteries are $20.

review/text: Pros:Pairing was easy. The thing does work, and is usable as an entry-level Bluetooth headset. Loved the mechanism by which it fits in your ear; that's very comfortable and secure at the same time.Cons:You pretty much get what you pay for. It looks nice, but it feels flimsy. When you plug the charger in, it feels like it doesn't fit, or you're putting it in wrong. That isn't a big problem, but it feels like a symptom of a cheaply made product.The performance of the AX2 I received was such that I thought it was defective and I sent it back for an exchange. It seemed like the connection between the headset and the phone was almost always plagued with bad static, the connection was dropped quite often, and people I spoke to while using the headset often complained that they could barely hear me.However, the replacement unit Amazon sent me (kudos to their return process and customer service, by the way) behaved exactly the same way, which tells me that this is just how this model is.In the end, I returned it and bought the just-released Plantronics Discovery 665, with AudioIQ (Amazon sells this, too, but I bought mine from Sprint). The difference is night and day. Of course, the Plantronics also costs several times as much, so it had darn well better perform.Overall, I'd say the AX2 is an okay deal if you buy it at Amazon's discounted price (do not go pay retail for this thing, it isn't nearly worth it and there are dozens of better models at the same price point), and you're only a casual user of the thing. I mean, for the most part it *does* work - just not particularly well.

review/text: I have had NO problems hearing or being heard with the Bluespoon. I love that it is so small and not very noticable. I also wear glasses quite a bit so I like that it doesn't go over the outside of the ear like a lot of them do. But probably the best thing about this little gadget was the price! $20 after rebate! can't beat that anywhere. If you have trouble with the rubber piece (that looks like an antena) that holds in your ear, just be patient and adjust it different angles until it's comfortable. I'm so used to it now, I hardly notice it and it doesn't bother me at all. Everyone that sees mine wants one!

review/text: This little dandy was quite a suprize in ease of use and performance.Pros:Very light. It doesn't have a AAA battery, but a coin one. This makes it extremely light, so it does not become irritating to the ear over time. Controls are easy to use. Because it does not hook over the outside of the ear, you can actually forget you have it on. I can still hear outside noises with it on, so I can conentrate on driving. Reception is very clear. It's smaller size keeps you from looking like one of those 'Star Trek Borg' people I see so many of out there. This was one of the cheapest Bluetooth headsets out there so I was worried about real-world quality, but this out performs many headsets approaching $100+.Cons:That little pointy thing coming out of the top, I originally thought was an antenna. It isn't. It's a soft rubber flexible fitting for inside the ear, and the long part actually curves around the inside fold of the ear and allows the unit to stay in place in your ear without the need to have a hook around the outside of the ear. At first I was dissapointed, but once I figured out it's intent, I was amazed at the ingenuity of it. Now its the best unit I have seen. Buy it. It's worth it.

review/text: Let's start with the product's biggest advantage: for $37 (shipping & taxes), you've got a bona fide bluetooth headset. For those of you who wear glasses (like me) you'll appreciate how this fits into your ear and doesn't battle with your glasses for the space above your ear. It didn't seem stable at first, but when I went for a jog, it stayed in there nice and snug.On the downside, it picks up most of the ambient noise from your surroundings, so conversations outside, doing any activity, or in a mildly noisy room will be difficult, at best. If you're just looking to stay legal while driving; however, this is a good option. Just make sure to turn off your radio, first.Bottom line: if you're a serious techie, looking for a bluetooth that will allow you to place calls while under water (and yes, they do make a model that boasts that), this isn't for you. If you're looking to see what the bluetooth is all about and aren't planning on using it extensively, this is a great bargain.

review/text: I paid [a dollar amount over twice what Amazon's charging, but that they'll delete if I put it here] for one at [a store the name of which Amazon will delete, but if you had a battery club card when you were a kid like I did, you've been there] when they were pretty much the only place to get one. Over the years I've tried headsets from AT&T;, Body Glove, Hello Direct, Jabra, and Plantronics, and I find the Bluespoon's soft spring to be the most secure and most comfortable method of fitting a headset to my ear (for that matter, Jabra headsets won't stay in my ear for more than seconds at a time, and Plantronics makes the most hideously uncomfortable earpieces on Earth).The soft spring does take a bit of getting used to, but that's true of anything that goes in your ear (and also somewhat true of the over-the-ear headsets as well). A good rule of thumb is to wear it for no more than half an hour the first day, and gradually increase the amount of time you wear it each day. It weighs so little that you really don't notice it after you've acclimated to having it IN your ear, not just ON it.Once you've learned how to insert it, the process is quick and one-handed. I don't have any issues with inadvertent button presses (thumb behind the bottom button, middle finger at the tip, and index finger popping the spring into the curve of my ear). And once you've inserted it properly, it's plenty loud. I have to assume that people who say it isn't loud enough just haven't figured out how to insert it.I had trouble with it disconnecting repeatedly from my phone even though it had a full charge, and it turned out that the Bluetooth connection in the phone had actually gone bad. The headset connected just fine to my computer, and the computer couldn't maintain a connection to the phone either. Once I got the phone replaced that problem went away. So if you have connection problems, test the headset with another phone before you throw it away in disgust. It might just be your phone.I bought a second one from Amazon because one of the buttons on my first one didn't survive the impact with the ground after the headset was knocked out of my ear -- I could turn the volume up, but not down. I've repaired that with my trusty soldering iron so now I have two that work. I've also bought one as a gift and recommended it to a friend who's very happy with his.Pluses: extreme battery life; light weight; comfort; Bluetooth 1.2 and handsfree profile support.Minuses: not the highest build quality in the world; replacement springs are nearly impossible to find; if you drop it and the battery is knocked loose, it won't reconnect to your phone until you plug in a power source again; good luck remembering all the button combinations for the handsfree profile.A minus only on paper: no noise reduction. In my experience noise reduction isn't worth the loss of battery power and increase in weight. I'd rather have a lighter headset that goes longer between charges.

review/text: This is my second Bluespoon AX2. The first suffered from a problem I later learned as common to the AX2 - refusal of the unit to charge after several weeks use. The AX2 is sensitive to the length of charge and will ultimately refuse to charge at all if it is not fullt run down to a zero charge and then fully charging it. It appears to also have a delicate power connector. If the supplied power charging connector is pushed all the way (without forcing) it can damage the AX2.The AX2 needs to be managed nd treated more carefully than a consumer device should require (beyond reasonable care).My new unit is starting to show signs of chrging problems (as my firt one did.

My Bluetooth 1.1 Sanyo Katana can't get more than 4 or 5 feet away but inside that and the clearity is great both in and out. Battery life is longer than my phone so that a plus. I really like the little tail thingy on the ear piece because it does a good job of securing the headset to my ear. I rarely have to turn the volume up all the way on the headset, and I don't have to speak loudly for the other end to hear me. The tiny size is awsome!The bad:The multi function button tends to shift and rattle a bit and every time I move my head and hear it, I think "cheap"The flashing blue LED is too bright in the car at night.Wind noise is a problem with this headset.I wouldn't steer anyone away from this headset who is looking for a low priced unit. Would I buy another one? It's possible. :)

review/text: I had this headset for about three weeks before returning it due to frustration. It was electrically defective, so I won't touch on that, but the ergonomics left much to be desired.It's billed as being good for people with glasses due to the little rubber thing that ingeniously tucks inside the curves of your ear. Unfortunately, it was uncomfortable for me, no matter how I trimmed the plastic. It may be comfortable for others, but it is worth noting that I couldn't get it to feel right even after patiently adjusting it for a couple weeks.Another problem is that it is tough to know whether the piece is set correctly in the ear. If it is, the audio is nice and loud. If it isn't, the sound is barely audible. A device that goes in the ear canal is a double-edged sword in this way. I'd put it on and fiddle with the volume buttons and adjusted them using the beeps produced, but when I answered a call, the headset may have shifted slightly, and the headset required more adjustment.The power button is on the front of the unit and sticks out. On top of that, the button requires very little pressure to activate. This makes it very easy to accidentally turn on if you put it in your pocket. This would be fixed if they designed the button "countersunk" into the unit.I think the idea for securing a headset in this way is good, and I really wanted to like it, but I just couldn't.

review/text: I was very happy with the bluespoon AX2 performance and ergonomics but was disappointed with its durability.The AX2 is incredibly small, light, and comfortable to wear. The sound quality is very good and the battery life is the same or better compared with other headsets. The maximum volume is considerably higher than the Motorola HS850 and Scala headsets I've used.This product has two primary shortcomings: Wind noise and durability. I've used several bluetooth headsets and the AX2 is the first one that ever broke from normal use. The charging interface eventually wore-out, and I had to wiggle the AC adapter and keep pressure on it to establish a good connection after only 4 months of use. The buttons also became loose over time and lost some sensitivity, and the battery began to lose its ability to maintain a charge after 4-5 months (although this may have been related to the charging port problems).Outdoors under light winds, listeners often complained that they could hear A LOT of noise. I had considerably more wind noise problems with this head-set than I had with the Moto HS850 and Scala models.I'm tempted to buy another one because it was so small and comfortable...

review/text: AX2 is very unnoticeable and comfortable when you wear it. It is very fragile. It has slipped out of my ear several times. Once dropped you must put it back on the charge for it to work again. A negative of the product is the rubber piece insert snapping off the back. Once it is gone, there is no way to connect the bluetooth to your ear. It only comes with two rubber pieces and you can not reorder the part. It does come with two chargers which is a plus. However, over charging the battery can cause it not to work. Overall, I like it and it works for me.

review/text: After reading the reviews on here in December (there were only about 15-20 at that time), I decided that even though this probably wouldn't be the best Bluetooth Headset on the market, it might be the best for the price. It had mostly good reviews at that time.So I bought it. I was so excited! I loved that it didn't have the over-the-ear thing 'cause I hate those things! Well, it seemed good at first - great functions, loved the way it fit with the rubber tail, extremely light.... BUT then I actually started using it - Once I made some adjustments to the rubber ear plug, I could hear people on the other end just fine, but the problem is that they always seemed to complain of getting bad feedback or me sounding like I was in a tunnel. So I always end up taking it off Bluetooth and just using the phone after about 5 minutes 'cause my friends can't stand it.Oh well. I guess the moral to this lesson is this... Bluetooth is still a fairly new technology with a lot of room for improvement, and at this point the only way to get a really great Bluetooth headset is to pay the big bucks ($75+) for one with the latest greatest best technology. If you're like me and you can't afford to do that, then you're probalby best off waiting until the technology improves and prices come down, because, yeah, I got this headset at a great price, but since it's worthless, I'd have been better off spending that money on something I could actually use (like groceries - hehe).

review/text: I just received my headset and it synced immediately with my Treo 650. Sound quality was great for the most part, and my caller's could hear me clearly. The small size is great.It was hard to get in my ear the first time, but once I got it in once, it was easy thereafter. Also the signal broke up a bit when I had my phone in my trouser pocket. I think the range is a bit short on the unit, but it wasn't too bad.

review/text: I have purchased several bluetooth headsets in my attempt to obtain a good quality sound. I purchased the Nextlink AX2 with the hopes of solving my search. I was not impressed. It was loud enough (as they stated), but with the volume turned up it created an echo for the recipient of the call. It is a ROYAL pain trying to get the thing in your ear while driving. Once in, it was fine. I hung up on several calls while attempting to secure it in my ear.I have put the whole thing back in the package and will try to return (though for the $30 less shipping both ways) it probably isn't worth my time.I have gone to the expensive H700 MotorolaAs they say -"you get what you pay for"

review/text: this headset kicks! i dont even want to call it a 'headset', cuz it's waay too small for that.it's available online for about 20 US bucks, and it's worth 10 times that, easily.after using a Jabra BT200 with my newy aquired motorola L2, i wanted something smaller, so i found this little nugget. the Jabra worked quite well, mind you, but was a little too big of a gizmo than i wanted to sling up off the top side of my ear.the bluespoon AX2 is unbelieveable. it felt, literally, like it wasn't there. it communicated (bluetoothed) to my phone seamlessly. it communicated to me (thru some beeps and chirps) flawlessly.it took about three days of heavy use to get the 'set comfy in my ear, yet comfy or not it was always very secure and clear, both incoming and outgoing. it sicks in your via one of two (lg or sm)"soft springs" which are just soft rubber thingys that follow the inner contours of your ear.(this thing held on even when my own glasses fell off my head!) (thanks, slayer!)i've read about some charging problems in some other posts, and i hate to report that i'm having some charging problems myself. seems the mini-usb connection is not very solid, maybe due to the fact that the thing is made of lightweight plastic.the only problem i see with this unit is the blinky-blue light. it blinks once every 10 seconds when it's on. it blinks alot more when you're on the line. blinking when you're on the phone is acceptable, even expected, but you should be able to turn it off, so as not to freak out the general public. (not everybody knows what a borg is..)so if you're looking for a cheap, light, comfortable, reliable, geeky, borg-like headset that's worth every penny, get a freakin sweet bluespoon ax2 beeootch!

review/text: Here's what I like about the headset:1. Extremely lightweight, with secure fit. It's easy to forget you have this on because it is so light. The soft spring easily fits into your ear and secures it. With the hook type headsets, there is some play during side-to-side head movement. This fits snugly in the ear and normal movements do not feel loose or unsecured. You do notice the speaker piece after it's been in your ear for more than a few hours, but it's not painful, just a little sore as there is only one size. I generally don't keep the headset in all day anyway, and only realized it because I had forgotten it was in.2. Incoming sound is very loud. It's in-ear design and fit allows you to hear very well. It's one headset I've used that I actually don't want at full volume.3. Has lots of ways to connect and conference calls. You can control switching from headset to handset from the headset, or connecting more than one call through the buttons.4. The blue talk light turns red when the battery is low, giving you a visual warning.Not so great:1. Lots of static in the bluetooth connection. I have my cellphone on my belt clipped on the left, and use the headset on the right ear. I do tend to notice this more when I am near a wifi source, but not always. I've also noticed it away from wifi signals (like my car). I've had the headset for about a week, and am still trying to figure out why a 3' distance on a 30' BT device would have so much problem with a clear connection.2. While the volume is loud, the sound quality is poor. My Motorola H500 wasn't nearly as loud, so I can't hear well when it's noisy, but the sound quality is much better. The AX2 sounds like midrange frequencies are boosted. While it may make voices easier to hear, it also sounds tinny and unnatural.3. Build quality is very mediocre. It's plastic, and I dropped it from waist level onto the parking lot surface. One of the volume buttons popped off, and the battery compartment was half popped out, as well as the plastic halves loosened. So now I don't have a volume button. I'd heard others say this unit breaks easily, and I can believe it might not have survived a drop from ear level.4. Headset tends to echo, although I don't know if it's worse than other BT sets. My Motorola echoed, but not quite as much as this. I don't notice it, but the person I call will mention it.5. The first day the power on/off tone was clearly audible. I don't know what happened, but after the first day the tone is muted so much I have to listen closely to hear the unit power on or off.I am still on the hunt for my ideal bluetooth set. Will try out the noise cancelling mics or bone conduction technology next because the older mic technology this represents leaves much to be desired.

review/text: i had originally bought the motorola hs820. i was using it with a moto krzr. i don't know if my particular headset was faulty, but the sound quality was horrendous. everything sounded tinny and even synthesized. someone told me that bluetooth just doesn't sound right with a moto phone. i returned that and bought this headset anyway (it's so cheap and amazon returns are very simple, that i decided to give it another go). i was shocked when i saw how small it is (you don't realize just from the pictures). it's incredibly comfortable in my ear, and the sound quality is just as it is from the phone. no difference at all, and people on the other end don't notice i'm using a headset. i recommend buying this over any others. it's definitely worth it!

review/text: When I first bought this headset in April 2006, it was amazing. It held up to all the hype, and I love how small it is. Within a month, however, it started having volume issues; nothing major, but when I would answer a call, it would start out on low volume. Easily fixed by increasing the volume on the phone or headset, but it would do this on every call, no matter how high the volume was set for the previous call. Two months ago I also started experiencing the charging issues described by others. When it was charging correctly, it would charge from completely dead to full in 2 hours; however, now it won't charge for more than 30 minutes, and battery life is abysmal. I have to charge it everyday, and even then it doesn't achieve near its original 8 hour talktime. I still give it 3 stars, because when it worked it was an excellent headset, and still is for the approx 2 hours a day I can use it. I'm thinking about trying the new Samsung WEP200, as it's a similar small, in-ear design, which is one of the best features of this headset.

review/text: I had this headset for 3 days. Dropped it from waist level and now it doesn't work. I could have gotten better use out of $30 by purchasing a fairly decent bottle of wine...it would be gone too, but I would have had more enjoyment out of it. This unit is very small, and getting it into the ear is awkward, and is impossible to do without pressing one of the volume up/down buttons, which means you will have to re-adjust. If you have larger hands, like I do, it is a little odd to handle...hence, the greater possibility of it being dropped. The sound was mediocre at best, and everyone I spoke to (in the short 3 days that it did work) said there was an echo on their end. Not recommended. Move on to another.

review/text: This BT headset is relatively small and unobtrusive compared to others I've seen. It is easy to use, the sound quality is acceptable and it fit my ear comfortably. After getting it, however, I realized that I really wasn't in love with the whole BT earpiece fad (people walking around, apparently talking to themselves, with a big plastic wart hanging out of their ear) - so I rarely use it. The only real complaint I can muster is that it is somewhat sensitive to wind noise and best used indoors or an enclosed area. If you have abnormal ears - it might not fit as well for you.

product/title: BoxWave Palm TX Armor Case - The Metal Case, Heavy Duty Protective Case (Black)
review/text: This is the second Armour Case I have bought for a Palm PDA; prior to this I had used the Palm brand had cases. Unfortunately, this will probably be the last Armour Case I purchase, not because of the case but because the Palm PDA's are no longer being made. Having said that, I would get it again in a minute if I had a need: it is easy to open but does not open by itself the way the Palm-made hard cases I have used do. It has the right cut-outs in the right places meaning I can plug it into the computer or the power cord while still in the case (unlike the Palm-made hard case, where you have to almost remove the unit to access these slots). Having TWO Palm PDA's stolen in the last year (Note to thieves: these are NOT phones, guys!), I was lucky to still be able to get a Palm replacement as well as another one of these cases. But, I doubt I'll be able to get another Palm PDA if it happens again, which is unfortunate.

review/text: I've used this case for over a year now. I carry my palm all the time in my jeans pocket, it goes everywhere with me. I've even dropped it a few times.The catch that holds it closed works well, not hard to open (though with two hands). If I stick too many receipts in the back of the case the catch won't catch.Possible downside? The hinge opens along the long side like a book, so if you use it oriented that way the case kinda gets in the way. If you use it turned the other way (my preference) the case sits nicely in my hand for writing-awesome.Never used the belt clip, I've had terrible luck with those things no matter what they're attached to (phone, ipod, whatever..)

review/text: When I got my new Palm TX, I knew I wanted a hard metal case. I had one for my T3 that was really ugly and had gaping seams that were grossly misaligned. But it protected my Palm from all the drops and abuse I could give it. So after reading the other reviews on this page, I didn't expect much more than protection.The case I got shipped to me is really well made. The seams are tight and straight, the device is held securely, the latch is secure without being inoperable, and access is available open or closed to the stylus, card, headphone jack, power and hotsync jacks. The heft, color and texture are pleasing, at least to me. I don't use the belt clip so I can't comment on its functionality. Although I bought this case as a temporary solution until I could identify something better, I don't know what would make a case better for me than this one.

review/text: One would think that the makers of a PDA would have the accessories for the PDA down pat, but I wasn't impressed with the Palm case I saw in person. This case as so many advantages to the Palm case that it's hard to list, but here's the highlights:*Palm case only comes in silver-ish and looks pretty tacky vs. this case comes in black.*Palm case and many others are not snug with the PDA, so it will rattle (not with this case).*The slip tab inside the case helps keep the PDA secure, so even if the case pops open, the PDA won't go flying.*Very secure latch. (I have a bit of trouble getting the case open, but I have bad nerves in my hands.)*Cutouts for everything (SD card, headphone jack, power button, etc.)*The cutout area for the headphone jack is actually big enough and doesn't impede the jack.*TWO SD card slots on the inside cover.*Soft inside lining.*Doesn't add too much bulk to PDA.About the only drawback I can see with this case is that the belt clip might as well not be included and is a piece of junk, but that seems to be the case with other Palm TX cases and I wasn't planning on using it anyway.Update Feb. 2009: I've had this case for nearly 2.5 years, so I got quite a bit of use out of it. Unfortunately, during a short drop, the peg holding the PDA into the case broke. The case protected the PDA perfectly, and it's still technically useable. The PDA just now doesn't stay in the case when it's open. I haven't found a replacement peg piece, so I'm going to have to buy an entire new hard case to protect my PDA and keep it in the case. I'm weighing the two options.

review/text: I have had this case for about 7 months and I am satisfied with its performance. It is well built and has protected my TX from damage. The Palm fits snugly and the case closes securely. The memory card slots are a nice touch, and the openings allow for access to all ports without opening the case.I can't comment on the sturdiness of the belt clip. I took it off the first day, as I usually carry my Palm in my shirt pocket.Cons: The case is very slippery so I stuck on some 3M non-skid strips to keep it from slipping out of my hand.I also wish the front cover opened and folded over the back, rather than just over 180 degrees.You have to watch the hinge pin, as it has a tendency to work its way out.I consider these to be minor shortcomings and I would recommend this case.

review/text: I purchased this case based on the reviews here, and on my own prior bad experience with a Palm case. This case looks neat, has cutouts so you can use all the ports and plugs with the case closed, and has a neoprene lining that fits very nicely. The SD slots have a much nicer design than Palm's. The minus to Boxwave's design is that it does not fold back flat against itself; the cover just flops at 180 and I can see that being a problem. Also, the hinge and clasp are external, taking up more space. The belt clip, which I would never use anyway, looks like an afterthought that would easily snap under any substantial force.

review/text: This is my second metal TX case (the other one was a different brand). I did my research before buying it and was accidentally shipped the wrong case. So I got to see what another case was like and I have a much greater appreciation for this one.Let me tell you, this one is excellent. I do not and will not use the belt clip, so I cannot vouch for that portion. Due to the excellent padding and fit, My PDA is very snuggly settled in the case. The case allows access to all of the TX features. It is very sturdy, protective, and adds very little bulk or weight to the PDA. The case will easily open if you are trying to open it, otherwise it stays closed. The case also has four tiny points on the bottom of it that will raise the case off the surface, so that if you are playing music, you can hear it with the speaker side down to the surface. It even has a tiny access hole to the reset button.I highly recommend it if you are scared of ever dropping your PDA or simply just want to protect you delicate, yet fairly expensive piece of equipment.

review/text: This simple matt black case is tough and the TX fits in it snugly. Its well designed to access ports without removing it from the case. I had a leather case for my last palm. It looked a bit more stylish but because it was soft it was always pressing on the command buttons and turning itself on. No such problem with this shell case. The only design improvement I would suggest would be a slightly rubberized exterior like I have on my motorola cell phone. It really helps me to keep from dropping it. The metal case is a bit slippery. I'm happy with it.

review/text: I purchased this after having a cracked screen on my TX, and paying a bundle for repairs. The little screen cover was on it, and covering the screen. Apparently having the side of the TX pinched caused the screen to get broken even while closed. After I'd sent it off for repairs I immediately went shopping and found this case. Exactly what a paranoid palm owner would want.The case looks pretty nice, though it does add some bulk. That is pretty unavoidable. All the ports are very accessable, and even the speaker is accounted for. I'm pretty happy with the fit. The edges are a little on the sharp side on some corners. It snaps closed nicely, and seems pretty snug. The hinge juts out a bit after closing, and I can see the pin might start to work out over time. The SD cards have to be inserted backwards, such that the metal contacts face you, or it will push out the card holder, which will then make contact with the screen. My final gripe is the most annoying.. as noted by other reviewers, you can only lay the case open, like a book. You cannot fold it back, behind the palm, out of the way.All in all I'm pretty happy, and haven't seen anything better. It looks like it will work well. I just see room for improvement.

The cheap plastic slide piece that attaches the PDA to the case would break in a stiff breeze. The neoprene lining lifts off in humid weather or whenever it feels like it.

review/text: The case is attractive, built like a tank, and the Palm TX fits easily and snugly inside. Though reasonably slim, naturally it does take up more space in your pocket. Since it's hinged like a book, you end up holding it like one- on your lap or a table. You can't leave it in the case if you use an after market cradle to charge/synch your Palm TX. Though the original Palm TX cover is rather skimpy, think of it as a bikini i.e. comfortable & covers the basics. The Armor case might be better for travel and rough environments.

I use my Palm in my pants pockets, and I like the fact that it does not get scratches at all, like the Palm original aluminum case. It does not rattle the Palm because it fits snuggly, unlike the original case. It has a back opening for the tiny speaker, so I think you can hear alarms louder. I've used mine for a month and I haven't have any problem with the plastic hinges that others described. It is somewhat difficult to open, though, that's why I give it 4 stars. You can charge and synch the Palm without open this case, unlike the original one. I do recommend it.

The springing thing won't hold it very well any more. The other day I got home from work and it was almost dark so I had to hurry and do some snowblowing. I heard a bump sound and didn't realize my Palm fell off the belt clip. I ran over it with my snowblower and it came out the shoot and hit the wall. I didn't realize it until I dug it out of the snow two days later. The TX was gaping open and the stylus was broken in half. I snapped it closed and the TX still works fine! Just had to get a new stylus. Weird, because my first TX died on me with no bumping around and I got this replacement one under warranty.

The problem lies with the plastic slide where you attach your Palm. It is flimsy and not detailed properly re. interface with the metal case itself. It invariably breaks after several openings/closings, if not before. I had a Rhino case before on another Palm and it looks as if I will have to try that or a leather one again.

Looks like there is enough clearance so cards will not press onto Palm's screen but I haven't tested that.

review/text: The case design is awesome, but steer clear of the metallic version. It scratches easily. Now I've got the black version and LOVE it. I like how the case protects my entire Palm TX. Not one corner of my TX extends beyond the case so if I ever drop it, it may be jostled, but not totally destroyed. The cut outs give you ample room to work with when turning it off or on and using cords, memory cards, or the stylus. There's even a little cut-out in the back for the speaker. The case latch is solid and doesn't pop open. Inside, there's a soft felt lining and slots for 2 memory cards. I don't use the belt clip, so this case is just fine for me and the price is right too.

review/text: Their DEFECTIVE product caused my palm tx to BREAK! I used the armor case and the belt clip that came with it the very day I got the package. My palm fell on the ground! Turns out the screw at the back of the armor case which was attatched to the belt clip was loose. Now my palm is broken. I emailed boxwave and this is the reply I got: "Our liability policy prevents us from providing additional compensation for it. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you."- All they offered was to replace the DEFECTIVE armor case with another one. As if I would ever trust their product again!!!

review/text: I wish I could give this 0 stars. I got this for my Palm TX, but as another reviewer experienced, the damn case wouldn't close!! The screw on the back doesn't seem very stable either. I just sent BoxWave an email complaining about this and demanding all of my money back, including shipping charges. What a crappy product. I think I'm going to try the Rhinoskin one instead.

review/text: I was looking at this case for a long time and now I have it in my hands. It is pretty much what I wanted for a Palm case to be. It is sturdy, has nice padding and fits my Palm just perfect. It might feel slippery a bit as someone admitted before but I don't find it that much. And yes, SD card holder is very handy. Belt clip is bit bulky but serves its purpose when you need it. Otherwise just disconnect it. So in short it is just what I wanted.

review/text: The aluminum case was disappointing. It looks like black plastic. Two of us struggled and struggled to get the Palm TX to fit in the case. After repeated attempts, we gave up and I e-mailed Boxwave. Finally after reading someone else's review, I realized that the funny piece in the middle of the case was supposed to slide into the TX. It worked fine after that. The box was labeled for the Palm Tungsten, not the TX. Simple instructions with the case, would've saved me a couple of hours of fiddling and e-mails. I agree with another reviewer who said the case is slippery also. I probably would not buy this again, but will keep it now that I have it.

review/text: I bought the silver version of this case and was very disapointed. The belt clip is of such cheap construction that the case would easily fall off my belt. On the bright side, it protected my Palm from breaking, but I would have preferred it not to fall in the first place. The case also had a tendency to flip open while on my belt, causing the whole thing to pivot on its flimsy clip. I don't recommend this product.

review/text: I just got the newest version of the Palm TX--and I'm not sure if they've changed the dimensions or anything--but this case does not close when I put my Palm TX in it. That's right, it doesn't work with the new TX. There is a small piece of plastic that is supposed to keep the palm in the case, but this is preventing the case from closing because the palm is too large.FYI. I will probably keep the product and just break off the little piece of plastic. But just so you know, don't buy this hardcase if you're getting a NEW Palm TX (with wi-fi and such).

review/text: I recently bought this product for my Palm TX and was equally disappointed as well as annoyed with the cheap belt clip. It isn't apparent in the photos, but there is a screw attached to the back of the case, which makes it impossible to lay flat. This I found extremely annoying. The clip (which you can take on and off) is extremely cheap and doesn't secure well. It flops and swirls around. Otherwise, the case would be fine. I do not recommend.

As far as the button style swivel belt clip, I have never seen one that works well and Ive had them on various phones and pda cases.

product/title: VG936: 9" Long Windshield Mount for Sony PSP
review/text: I've had this windshield mount for a few months now, and while it works, I can't really say that I would recommend it to anyone else.As the other review said, it shakes quite a bit while driving. However, that is bearable compared to the real problem--the pivot head is just not very sturdy. Hitting the smallest bumps on the road, or even just turning, could cause the pivot head to swivel, leaving your PSP in a slanted position.The pivot head swivels while driving whether or not I have the PSP docked in the windshield mount, so it's not an issue of weight. I end up having to adjust its position every few minutes, which is not exactly the safest thing to have to do while driving.

product/title: Nokia BH-600 Bluetooth Headset for all Bluetooth Enabled Phones
review/text: This was my first bluetooth headset I purchased, and I made sure I researched it before I bought it. All the signs pointed to a great product. I went with this as opposed to another manufacturer because I wanted to stick with the Nokia brand. The pairing to my Nokia N75 was problematic at first, but that was only because I didn't do it correctly. Read the directions on how to do it. The build quality of this is exceptional. It doesn't creak like my new BH-602 does when you grab it. This headset along with my N75 are both bluetooth 2.0 so things sounded great while talking to people, and the range is good. Walking 20 feet away with a wall in between the phone and I, there was a little static, but I expect that with bluetooth. Sound quality is very good on all calls. People sounded very clear. However, volume wise, it could be louder. That's the only thing I saw as a downside, which is why I gave it 4/5 stars. All buttons are easy to press and locate, so no worries there. Battery life on this is amazing considering the battery size. I get 7 days usage out of single charge on about 3 hours of calls with multiple disconnections and connections from my phone. I let it sit for 11 straight days, and it still had a charge, so I was VERY impressed. The specs say 9.17 days of standby time. This will beep if the battery is starting to get low also. The weight of this may be an issue for those looking to wear this for more than 2 hours, but maybe it's just me. It's not a heavyweight, but you will feel it. It's a shame that this product simply didn't fit my ear. The only time it ever did was when I had a beanie on and it was smashed into my ear. You can bend the earloop to your liking to secure it on your ear, but if you have a small ear opening, this probably won't be a good fit. If this were an in-ear design like a lot of others, it would be excellent for me. But for someone else, it might be a great solution. Great headset.

review/text: This accessory is limited by the microphone dangling near your face. This does not for clear transmission of voice and the complaint of listeners is too much background noise. To make the accessory really work well, you have to cup the microphone in your hand next to your face. In this case, you may as well put the phone next to your face since you are no longer &quot;hands-free&quot;. It would be better for Ericsson to create an adapter allowing a true headset with directional microphone that would be in front of your mouth. This would minimize background noise.

In spite of being shipped USPS, it showed up the first day of the delivery window. I plugged it in and snapped on the cover (which actually seems marginally sturdier than the original), charged it... And didn't charge it again for a week. *FLAWLESS*. Dirt cheap bargain basement price, and my talk time went from 20 min (with a bluetooth headset) to over 3 hours...

review/text: I have a Motorola E815 phone approaching 4 years old and the original battery was only lasting about a day. I had heard that a new battery would cost me about the re-up price for a new phone from Verizon. Since my life is quite transitional now, I really didn't know what phone I wanted or needed, hence when I found this battery for less than $10 delivered I thought it was worth the shot. I think I ordered it on Friday and it was in the mail Monday, much faster than I expected. The battery and the new back still fits within my leather case, and it gives probably four days with moderate use. More usage cuts it down, but I still get a couple of days before it needs to be recharged.

review/text: Stop fooling around with clipped conversations and embarrassing lost calls. Its so nice not to worry if you have enough juice to finish the call, or sweat the fact that you forgot to charge the phone last night. With this battery it'll wait till tomorrow. Just checked mine after two days off the charger. The phone still shows a fully charged battery. I have never had this battery go dead in use.My only concern was if the larger size would require a larger phone holder. It adds only a 1/8 inch in thickness, if that. The back fits just as well as the OEM, same color and everything. This is an easy decision.

review/text: Let's face it, unless you want to go iPhone, there's not much exciting about the current cell phone market. I've had my Moto v710 since September 2004. The only problem I was having was battery life. I bought 2 of these replacement batteries because of the price. I figured just in case one is a dud I'll have a second and still it wouldn't be a bad deal. The battery is awesome - longer life than the original battery when it was new. I got it back in May and it's still working great - haven't noticed much decline in its lifespan either. And if it does ever start to lose charge, I still have an unopened one. Do yourself a favor and get 2... you'll be set until a worthwhile phone comes along that is worth the upgrade.

review/text: First this is a beautiful phone with a beautiful size and a beautiful feature-set targeted for a busy biz type. Features are tri-band for reception, Dictaphone for voice memos, Speakerphone for hands free, and PDA features for; contacts w/address, calendar for todo and event alarms with day/wk/mo/yr repeatability on recurring events like weekly meetings, birthdays, take out the trash :), etc.ALL the features work great. Plenty loud receiver, ringers, vibrator, and speakerphone, all adjustable. Has a separate power switch on top for quick access to ringer options(one press) or power-off(press and hold)for batt save, etc.It is so small you can wear it in the watch pocket of jeans, in a shirt pocket, or your pants pocket without a bulge. Still, the keypad layout is such that I find it easy to dial because the keys cover the total keyboard, unlike my previous SE T234 small point buttons. For those who derated this phone for its small size, I don't get it? If you want a bigger phone that has bigger keys and a bigger screen, get one for heaven sake. Please rate a phone for its features and performance, not its size. That is a positive for those who want this.Those looking for a well featured small phone with Nokia's quality and RF reception, you will not be disappointed with this one. You will not get a camera, radio, mp3 player, tv size screen, or memory enough for gobs of games, ringtones, wallpaper, screensavers and video(this is the Nokia 6230i). You will get an excellent and practical communication and organizational device having enough memory for adequate games/ audio/video accessories and the features required for the practical user, and a good price.Pros: Power/Ringer quick access button, loud but adjustable receiver, powerful vibrator and flashing keyboard silent modes, small and VERY stylish, dictaphone, speakerphone, user definable Shortcut/Goto list, Org Calendar/Calc/Stopwatch/Countdown/Alarm, Nokia RF reception, PC sync with Nokia's free down-loadable SW. Standard barrel-type charger plug.Cons: Non-standard headphone jack, no side button volume control, non-customizable navigation keys.

review/text: I've always owned a Nokia phone simply because it works for me(and I'm a creature of habit). =) If you could care less about owning a tricked out, camera flip-phone with all the bells and whistles, then this phone is for you. The one thing that really differs with this phone (compared to the three other Nokias I've had over the years) is that these buttons are really small and it can literally be a pain sometimes when you're sending text messages. After owning this phone for nearly a month now, here's what I've summarized:Pro's:* It's inexpensive* Nice, color display screen* Has a useful voice recorder* Speakerphone is very useful (esp. if you're driving and don't own a headset)* You can change your right, navigation button to create faster shortcuts* Somewhat user-friendly for those that are cell phone challenged* Comes with a sleek travel size charger* If you're a Cingular customer, this got better reviews compared to the fancy-shmancy (and more expensive) Samsung, LG and Ericcson phones they also offer.Con's:* Teeny, tiny key pad* Ring volume has a big difference between levels 2 and 3* If you own a headset for older Nokia phones you have (such as a 3595), it won't work with this one. You'll have to splurge and buy a new headset. =(* Ring tones are kind of weak, I'm 30 and it feels like they had teens in mind when creating ringtones for this phone (same thing with the wallpaper options).* Games are cool, but the bowling game is only limited to +/- 5 games before you're denied access.Hope this was useful for anyone interesed in buying this phone. =)

review/text: I recently subscribed to a two year Cingular service. At first I purchased a Motorola V551, but that gave me poor reception compared with my Samsung E315, which I previously owned. Not wanting an expensive phone that would drop calls frequently, I decided to trade it in for a Nokia, becasue my father used Nokia ever since he started to use cellular services, and he was extremely satisfied. The Nokia 3120 appealed to me because of it's styling. Although it is not as technologically advanced as the phones I was used to, the styling appealied to me, along with the fact that the phone was 39.99. I truly like the styling. It is the best I've seen in the bar phone class. It is not outlandish in any essence. It is a smart phone for people who want basic functionality. What also appeals to me is the user interface. It is the best one I've seen for any phone. It is the smae interface used on all digital nokias, which date back to about 1996, which is when I first was exposed to Nokias. It is extremely simple to use, the most convinient features can be accessed with two or three button pushes. The biggest thing that got me to purchase this phone is it's reception. Better than any phone i've used. I can use it deep inside buildings. My mother has a Nokia 6010, and she can call from the breakroom in her office, which is in the center of the building. All this packed in a sleek, understated enclosure makes this phone very pleaseing.My only complaints about this phone is the lack of "fun" features, such as a camera or video playback. If you really want a camera phone, but like what you hear abou this Nokia, the 6230 is for you, and I will buy that in 6-12 months. Another thing I do not like is the color. You can get covers for it, but the middle part of the phone, where all the circuitry and the antenna lie, is pasty white, which for a guy like me, is girly. One of my friends commented exactly. One flaw, though it does not bother me, is the size of the phone. While it is higly portable and compact, the buttons could be too small for some.A summary of pros and cons (some i did not list above)ProsStyling and portabilityUser interfaceReceptionBright DisplaySpeaker phoneNokia dependabilityConsColor choicesize of keypadlack of "fun" features such as camera, although it has a camera attackmentI know this review is very long, but I wanted to cover all aspects of the phone so as not appear bisaed in any direction.

review/text: I've had mine for over a year now, so I thought I'd offer some comments.First, buy a case. This is not a particularly tough phone. My teenage son killed his within six months. Then again, he was always tossing it around and dropping it. I've dropped mine too, but the case has kept it looking good.This is a small phone. If you've got big fingers as I do, it may give you some difficulty. I wouldn't buy a smaller phone, but this one fits nicely about anywhere.The display is quite bright once you get the settings right. Perversely, the display is best with the wallpaper off and the brightness "down." When you turn it up, it just washes the text out.The alarm clock is fine, and the aftermarket accessories available for interfacing with a PC work well enough with a little fiddling. I've loaded my own MIDI files as ringtones. Not all of them load correctly, so you'll have to experiment with that.The speakerphone isn't particularly powerful from the user end, but the person you're talking to seems to hear you well enough.All in all, a decent - but not outstanding - phone. I've looked at others but, for now, have stayed with my little Nokia.

However, I returned this phone after one day of use because:- the sound quality was not good: static was present in the background of all of my calls.- when I put the phone near any speaker, the phone caused the speakers to make very disruptive bleeping noises.

review/text: I'm not going to bore you with the many features that this particular phone has since its user's guide is online at Nokia. My complaint is about how small the numbers (4,6,7,9) are. To dial a number one has to actually use both hands since using one hand can lead to mistakenly dial the intended number. I don't have large hands at all and have found this problem to be very cumbersome to overcome with one hand. One user also complained about the screen going blank when recharging. I agree with him. This happens only if the phone is off but the user is left wondering whether the phone is charging or completely charged. I don't know of any phone that blanks out when charging.-AC

It has text messaging, multimedia messaging, polyphonic ringtones, MEDIA NET, to download many more ringtones, games, applications, ANYTHING else you may want or need for your nokia 3120, can be found on media net. It's the internet on your phone, letting you download practically anything you may want, including java apps. If youre at work, the movies, or dont feel like calling anyone, you can go ahead and use your instant message feature, by logging onto AIM or YAHOO to chat with your buddies. There are many more features to this phone - like any screensaver you could want, you can even record your own voice or music to use as a ringtone.Popular? 300 contacts/Calendar with 500 entries.Cant get up in the morning? Alarm clock.Timing something? Stopwatch/countdown.Bilingual? English, French, Spanish, Portuguese languages supported.You can talk for 6 hours if you like on this phone, or you can go ahead and leave it on your desk for over 16 DAYS, yes DAYS, and still be able to talk. Total standby time is 17 days.The call quality is great, except if you put the the phone too close to a stereo or your speakers, it makes the speakers beep, which is the only downside, but is totally negligable.I'd give this phone 4/5 stars, because of all the features you can have on a phone that's 4.01 inches long x 1.68 inches wide x 0.76 inch thick, and weighs just about 3 ounces.

review/text: I only needed a basic phone - no MP3, camera, or FM radio. This phone delivered with great reception, good sound quality, great battery life, and a very small size. Inside a building it works great. Why the low score? The tinted plastic over the display makes it impossible to see the display outdoors and in the car. If the sun is out, forget it! I even managed to figure out how to remove all of the wallpaper backgrounds and to maximize the contrast. Still, don't plan to use this outdoors. Nokia should recall this product to replace the tinted cover. Update: Yesterday this phone took was accidently dropped onto a very hard ceramic tile floor and it still works perfectly! A similar drop ended the life of my digital camera a few months ago. So, if I were to rate this cell phone now I would give it 3 stars, maybe even 4 stars. I like reliable, sturdy stuff and this cell seems to be unusually well made.

review/text: I was looking for a durable phone that could take a blow or pressure and keep working. I also did not want random pieces of it falling off when it was struck. I'm a fairly small individual and I also needed a phone that had to be small enough to fit into my pocket comfortably with no protrusions to gouge me. I did not need a camera or any extraneous features like that. This phone seems to be fitting these criteria perfectly. I was planning on spending quite a bit on a phone to meet those criteria, but I was pleasantly surprised to find this phone was free on my plan.I have dropped it a couple of times from about 10-12 feet up onto concrete and it keeps working just fine. It has slid for about 20 feet across a piece of concrete. It does have some minor scuffs after this but nothing significant. It does not have any buttons on the sides so there is nothing there to have fallen off when it hit the concrete. It has been submersed in a water tank and seems to have come back from it well also.As far as visibility of the display issues that other people have mentioned in their reviews, I have noticed that it has what seems to be a "power save" type situation it kicks into where the display is difficult to read. Hitting certain keys seems to kick this "mode" off. Other than those situations I have had no more difficulty reading the display than on other candy bar style phones I have had from Nokia. I have used it in direct sunlight and in various other lighting situations.

review/text: Here's how I rate this cellphone:1. Voice quality and reception: +12. Battery life: +13. Fast opening and browsing of menu and sub-menus: 04. Build and keypad spacing: +15. No useless accessories: +1Bottomline: 4/5.The other reviewers are right about the screen in sunlight: it sucks. But if you're like me and are chained in a cube for the daylight hours, it doesen't matter that much.The only thing I dislike about this handset, is that it is quite slow in opening its submenus. I would have thought that such a basic, stripped phone would be lightning fast; indeed, it was one of the reasons I bought it, but not so. Gone are the days you could unlock your phone and call a contact within a second.Besides this con, it is solidly built, has exceptional voice quality, and is easy to dial with if you have thick fingers.

review/text: NOT even an 'entry level' phone as they would have useful basic functions. Entry level should have a screen you can see in the light and a reliable ringer. Display has no brightness adjust only contrast which is useful for making the screen harder to see not improve. Using any wallpaper but white makes the screen impossible to see/read text even indoors in all but a dark room. Fonts have a setting to enlarge (Nokia knew the screen was junk) text but the small display prevents this. Calls have barely audible sound quality to understand the conversation (not due to signal). Buttons are too small for hands larger than medium-sized fingers and don't always make contact first time. Screen back-light doesn't always light when first button is pressed. When backlight is off screensaver time display is impossible to read when activated. Battery time is good most likely due to screen being dimly lit. User settings are all over the place in a unintuitive fashion making personal settings a time consuming chore instead of one menu.I can do w/o camera, web, mp3, radio etc. but to fail in the basic functions of a cell phone is pretty bad & not acceptable. No wonder they PAY you $150.00 to take the phone.NO STARS

review/text: I see this highly rated and don't understand how that can be, unless screen visibility is of no concern to those reviewers. Look before you buy this one!I'd never recommend this 2610 because of the single issue that the display is unusable in daylight & barely marginal for inside viewing. It's a shame because the sound is good. Maybe that's why AT&T; gives them away free - hoping to get rid of them.

review/text: This Nokia is about as simple and basic a telephone gets nowadays.You get good sound quality and easy texting in a compact unit.The major drawback is very poor highlighting of menu icon selections.If you have activated many features, this cell will frustrate you.It's a crapshoot what you actually select. I had to buy 2X magnifying specs in order to utilize menu features.Also, the signal strength and battery power indicators can be very difficult to see - minor points considering AT&T; functionality (damnedgood) and rapid battery charge rate.The vibration indication for incoming calls is very effective, and ringtones can be adjusted easily.In regards to pricing, AT&T; sometimes will give this cell free for activating two years service. The highest price AT&T; ever charged for this Nokia is $9.99, in refurb condition.I've had my Nokia for half a year, and I appreciate it; it's not perfect, but it is useful. A phone should be a phone, not a portable entertainment system. Thanks to the magnifier specs, I don't have to squint at the screen anymore.

review/text: As a seventeen year old female, I do tend to use the phone a lot. I got this phone without texting, and I still love it. I have no idea what the other users are talking about with the backlight, mine is always perfectly viewable. Maybe they just need a teenager to work it. ;PThe only problem I have with the phone is that I have a nickel allergy, and the metallic looking finish on the menu and surrounding buttons caused my face to break out with a rash, but as long as I use the easy-to-use speakerphone button, or get a good cover or headset, I should be fine.This phone was easy for even my 60 year old father and computer inept mother to figure out, with minimal help from me. I wish the record function wasn't so scratchy so I could record songs for ringtones, but what do you expect when most people can afford texting and ringtones.I would give it 4 and 1/2 stars, but as I can't a full five stars for this product!

review/text: I'm writing a review for the first time because I've never been so dissapointed with a shopping experience. I bought cell phone cases from World of Bags so that I could give them as Christmas gifts. I ordered them on December 5th. It took them until December 19th to confirm that they were being shipped! It was as if they were waiting for the last minute to ship me my items. [Amazon has a two week policy for shipment of products.] Needless to say, I did not get to give them away as Christmas gifts. This is the type of service I got for choosing standard shipping -which was very expensive to send two little cell phone cases(I can't specify how much because they won't let me post prices in reviews)! They also shipped them seperately. A sign of inefficiecy, indeed. One came in an appropriately sized bubble envelope and the other in a huge box. I've decided to not return the items because I want to cut my losses now and just never order from them again.

The external LED isn't even mentioned in the user's manual. It's there purely for decoration, apparently. The software on the phone is of a generally clunky quality. I can get to the Ringtones shop in one click, but if I miss a call, it's 3 or 4 clicks to check for the caller's identity. You can see where Cingular's priorities are...The one mitigating factor I'll mention is that the reception has improved greatly since I installed the new antenna that I was sent by Cingular.Next time, I'm buying a Nokia or a Samsung.

review/text: This is a simple to use, small, light and generally elegant flip phone, with good reception.Some useful comments for those interested in getting it:-It looks nice and has a fast and responsive user interface (I found the LG interface much better than the Samsung x426). It is easy to move from menu to menu by pressing the shown number (or scroll around and press select if you want).-Some useful functions are hidden away under three menu levels (ie Calculator, Alarm, Calendar). There is no way to assign a shortcut. There are built-in shortcuts to internet, text messaging, contacts, instant messaging.-It is easy to put the phone to vibrate, even without opening it.-The light on the outside lights red if there is a waiting message (voice or text) but not when you have missed calls.-You cannot use most of the phone's functions when talking on the phone. (ie you cannot play games if you have a headset and are having a boring conversation.) But you can take a 'note' and later save it as a phone number.-The phone can only &quot;ring and vibrate&quot; at the highest volume.-The volume control for the games is tied to the volume of the ringer. So if you lower the volume while playing and forget to increase it afterward, the ringer will be quiet. Also, if the phone is set to loudest ring, some menu confirmation will elicit a loud sound from the phone (ie entering a new contact.) This is annoying.

review/text: Alas, my trusty Nokia cell phone died horribly and slowly, the folks at the cell phone store had to put it out of its misery. Having driven there through traffic and rain, I was surprised to find my options for a replacement limited, especially since my now dead Nokia had lasted just slightly longer than its warranty.I left with a nifty little (slightly) used LG 1300 as the replacement and decided to let a month go by and see what I thought. At this point, the pros outweigh the cons, but, one person's pro might be another's con and vice versa. Human nature being what it is, I think it is more fun to focus on the cons first.First the battery life is short, and the claim that this phone has up to 240 minutes of standby is debatable. There should be some sort of way to shake this thing around and generate a bit more time. Better yet, if one could hop violently from side to side as though afflicted with St. Vitus' Dance (which is a self-limiting disorder of movement caused by both streptococcal infection and by talking loudly on cell phones in crowded venues) and recharge the battery, then that would be very entertaining to watch.Next, this phone is so small that it could be confused with a big pack of chewing gum. This feature is bad only if you keep a cluttered desk or satchel and keep having to call your cell phone from your desk phone in order to locate the little gizmo. The washing machine poses another, perhaps lethal set of consequences that could stem from the size of this phone.We need to talk about the buzzer/vibrate setting, a feat of malicious engineering that deserves Cingular----I meant singular----mention. A pair of nondescript, tiny buttons grace the left side of the LG 1300. These buttons magically change the phone's setting from vibrate, silent, or ring if you accidentally press them. So when the phone rings, it's best to poke it with a stick first, then flip it open from the junction of the bottom/top not the sides.(Permit me a parenthetical word about the buzzing or vibrating here. If you have a small chassis from a toy car available, you set the LG 1300 to vibrate, attach it to the chassis with a rubber band, put it on tray or cutting board and presto, you have a dynamic cat toy! Just call your number from another phone and your felines will pounce all over this sleek, mouse-like marvel.)I was surprised at the poor selection of ring tones---or is it spelled solid as ringtones?---available, but then I found that the initial menu pick on the phone takes one to a media mall. I haven't visited there yet, but if I'm ever hungry I may try out the food court.There are good things about this phone. The buttons sort of click when you press them, which makes it seem like you are entering data into one of those tricoders from the any of the various Star Trek series. Using the menus is pretty intuitive (unlike say those in a French restaurant), and changing the settings requires minimal effort.Once flipped open, the earpiece and mouthpiece are sort of in the vicinity of the human ear and mouth, respectively, which does make a degree of sense in the design of a telephone! Plus this phone does not have a camera!! It's bad enough to have to talk to some of my friends, but if I also had to look at them, I would never use the phone.I've also had some trouble with calls being dropped, and if this is happening because of some undocumented feature in the user manual, then I would like to know what it is. To me, this is not necessarily a bad thing because there is simply no better way to get out of an uncomfortable or unwanted conversation than to hang up on yourself.The sleek, curved, compact case makes one feel a bit like a spy, so the coolness factor should not be discounted entirely. And the designers even included this wild little mirror on the outside. Although this tiny mirror gets smudged quite a bit, who knows, it could someday save your life if you are ever stranded and need to attract the attention of any would-be rescuers once your phone's battery has died.Postscript: On November 15, 2006, I made the offhand remark that I was going to replace this phone soon. That night, it stopped working. I won't miss it.

review/text: The LG C1300 is a sleek, small and very nice cell phone!! Since this is my first one, I was shocked when I got it for Christmas!!! I couldn't believe it!!! This phone is amazing by having an incredable LCD display that is bright and clear! It has very good sound quality when talking/listening to people and when listening to ringtones. There are a few "cool" ringtones such as: Twilight and Rock Me, but that's about it. I would recommend buying your own. The one of the down sides for me is the battery life. The talk time is only four hours and stand-by time isn't that long either. Since I don't talk on the weekdays anyway, I usually leave my phone off. But during the weekends, I talk on it forever causing the battery to run low. Another down side is the external mirror. I wish it could have been an external caller ID or something nice. The only useful thing is the LED light implanted in the mirror telling if your phone battery is charged or not. Overall, for my first cell phone, this is great!! Has everything I wanted in a cell phone! The only two concerns are battery life and the external mirror. If you are considering in buying a cheap yet great quality design, BUY THIS!!!

review/text: First, I hope no one reading these reviews is considering actually paying for this thing. I think that you shouldn't even take it for free, for two reasons: 1. you'll be paying a bundle a month for a service you can barely use, and 2. you probably passed up another free phone that no matter how bad it is, has to be better than the LG 1300.My major complaint is dropped calls. (The battery life is a little thin, but I would say not a major problem.) But it's really tough to have a conversation more involved than "when are you getting home?" "seven." "okay, see you then." because you will spend half your time saying, "wait, can you say that again?" The reception is awful (/with/ the new antenna) even when the phone doesn't drop calls. Plus, the sound quality is really poor, and as other people have said you have to grind the phone into your ear to make out anything the other person is saying.DO NOT take this as a free phone as I did - ANYTHING would be better. If you have the choice between this phone and a cardboard box with numbers written on it, choose the box. At least you can keep photos in it.

Another thing about this phone is the ringer it cannot be turned off ascending so you cant hear the ringtone untill about 20sec later. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE

review/text: C1300i is the upgraded version with better reception now. Just got it so no comment on the battery life but one of the web review praise the battery life and reception.This one I just got has a bad text LCD screen that is hard to read but the graphic screen is bright and clear. Weird.Will go back to Cingular store to get it fixed or exchanged.

review/text: This phone is consistent with the quality of phones I've received from Cingular. It's A PIECE OF CRAP! I too, get no reception in my own house, and it holds a call like greased hands hold a greased ball of grease that was soaked with grease with a grease soaker. It is the worst of the worst. The speaker is crap, of you shift it at all from your EAR HOLE... sorry for the technical lingo... but if you do that, you won't hear anything. It won't charge unless the phone is turned off, and the battery lasts for about two hours of talk time, and about a day of powered on time. The most irritating part is the battery, but the dropped calls is a close second. I swear you can have five bars, but as soon as you push the call button, it will drop to two... DO NOT CHEAP OUT AND GET THIS PHONE! UPGRADE!

review/text: I am actually on my second phone because the other just stopped working. Sometimes it would not allow me to touch certain keys, so I sent it back to Cingular. I thought the problem would be resolved after I got a new phone, but I was wrong. Now sometimes when I go to use the phone I will try to dial out and it will say EMERGANCY ONLY and all bars are full for reception. Another thing it does is go off on it's own. It also takes a long time to read the sim card when turned on about a minute. Another issue is the ring tones are verylow on sound so I hardly ever hear it ring unless on vibrate and it's in my pocket. Sometimes to phone will alert me of a voice mail message but no list of missed call. Or it will ring a half hour later informing me of a message received when I have another call. I hate this phone so much. Sometimes when it does not allow me to call out I will open up the battery back and reinsert the sim card then it all of a sudden works or I will hit it against my hand and it will work. This Phone is a curse do not get it. My coworker has this phone and she has the same problems. I can't believe I paid $129. on this dam phone.

review/text: I renewed my 2 year wireless contract for the 2nd time last week and had decided to upgrade my phone. I've had 2 previous Nokia phones free with my plan. I really liked Nokia's performance, but my phone provider does not offer any with a flip phone style. Because I'm on the road a lot, being able to put a smaller phone into my pocket, briefcase, of handbag without dealing with locking and unlocking the keypad each time I used it is a real convience. I also wanted to get a stroner signal than I was able to get with he Nokia. I use a company provided Moterola Flip Phone that is newer than my Nokia and get a really great signal with it. I paid $50 for the LG C1300 phone. I was assured by the salesperson that the LG brand, although new, was in their experience performing well. This phone has only a fraction of the features my 2 year older model Nokia had, the signal is worse than any I've ever had and the phone is not very user friendly. Now unless I pay full price won't be able to upgrade again for 2 years and am stuck with junk. BUYER BE WARE! DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!

review/text: i have this phone, but in the prepaid version. It is the cingular GO PHONE. I have some likes and even more dislikes of this phone. In prepaid version, it only has one game, spaceball. Which is just SNAKE with a different name. It says you can go on the different types of instant messangers, use the internet, and download different graphics, tones & games. but that is not true. every time i go to use any of them .. it always say GPRS not found. i have no clue waht that means, but i guess prepaid versions were ripped off with the choice of internet and pretty much all fun, if any, with this fone. This fone has good quality ringers, only 1 or 2 good backrounds. HORRIBLE reception. every time i try calling my friends out on my bike or something, i have to jam the fone up to my ear just to hear them. it has vibrate which is good for when im in class, because my parents always tell me to turn off my fone is school, but when you turn it off, if anyone calls, you wont be able to see missed calls if its turned off so i just keep it on.it has .. i think 20 ringtones. theyre ok. it has speed dial. but no voice dial and no voice recorder :( also no speaker :(it does have 255 fone book entries available and i think it has like 3 way calling and call waiting so thts ok. so yeh i guess i wood reccommend this fone .. but now let me recap all the things this fone dont have SPEAKERFONE, VOICE DIALING, VOICE RECORDER, INTERNET, RINGTONE,GRAPHIC,GAME AND MULTIMEDIA DOWNLOAD, CAMERA, VIDEO CAMERA, ughh i dont know why i even got this fone but yeah thats all the things it doesnt have so there ya go. and if you want good reception, dont get this fone !!

This is by far the worst reception on a cell phone that I've had in the 10 or so years I've been using cell phones. I can't use it at all inside my house. Even when I'm driving and I'm getting a strong signal sometimes I can't make out what the other person is saying. I feel like crushing this phone sometimes. I have had people call me 3 or 4 times and I never know about it and than they will get through to me and say that they've been trying to call me and while we are talking it will notify me that I've missed 3 calls.

review/text: This phone is worthless. I have now had it for 3 years and felt I may as well give my input in case anyone else was considering buying it since I am researching a new phone. Here are my main issues with this phone:- The User Interface is horrid. I am a web developer and usability engineer so I can state that as a fact. The UI on Nokias is 10x better. The fact that I still hate the UI after 3 years should really tell you something. This issue alone is 90% of the reason I hate this phone.- Dropped calls. Poor reception. Once again nothing like my old Nokias (which were all free Cingular phones.) I also have the antenna "upgrade". Made no difference AT ALL.- Side volume controls. I used to always want a phone with convenient volume controls on the side until I got this. If it is in your pocket (or purse if you are female) you will find the buttons get hit all the time and will turn your vibrate on and off and make your phone beep. Obviously this problem isnt specific to this phone but it is something to consider in cellphone design.On the plus side, the phone is generally always reliable. The volume is decent. The speaker has held up better over time than my Nokias did (they had noticable volume degradation over time).Also, it wasn't until recently until the battery starting having problems holding a decent charge. I got in a solid 2 years of good battery/charger performance. Definately long enough to wait out your contract and get a new phone.

I had mine replace with the "upgrade" and noticed no difference with reception.Even though I got this phone for free from Cingular I feel like I was ripped off. I spoke with an employee at a Cingular store and he agreed with me that it is a horrible phone.

However, the battery would only last for about two days with the new one, and I had to buy a new battery.

review/text: I got this phone over three years ago. It doesn't have many features, but it has worn like iron and that matters more. The lack of a speakerphone setting really annoys me, I'll admit, and so does the lack of a camera phone, but those weren't common features back in 2004. The vanity mirror is kind silly, but I have to admit that has been very useful to me over the years. (Which isn't to say a display in its place wouldn't have been more useful, but at least a mirror isn't totally useless to carry around.)Some people have said they have problems with reception using this phone. This has never been a problem for me, but the coverage area could have something to do with that. I actually get better coverage with this phone than most of my AT&T; friends do on their newer devices.After three years of use, I'm retiring this phone for an updated, unlocked phone. It has been dropped, rained on (heavily,) and even thrown long distances, but it still works fine to this day. A sick, girly, self-absorbed part of me is thinking, "What am I going to do now that my cell phone doesn't have a vanity mirror?" (Another part of me is psyched to finally have a camera-phone.)

It has a well lit screen and the volume of the ringtones are really loud. The hearing part is awesome, i put it on a volume 3, because when it was on a 5 its like a speaker phone. It only includes one game which is very similar to snake. The picture does not look the same, the big thing in the middle is really a mirror like thing and it flashes green, it does not stay solid.

review/text: For years, I have resisted the whole cellphone, constantly connected to the world thing. Then, this Christmas, my folks decided to put me on their Cingular family plan and finally force a cellphone on me. At the cellphone store, all I cared about was finding something small, simple, and unobtrusive. This phone seemed like it would fill those requirements perfectly. Well, it has. Both call quality and battery life have seemed more than adequate. I live on the edge of civilization in northwest Colorado where cell towers are few and far between, but I have had what is (to me) suprising success in getting a good signal where one would expect one to be. It's small size is a real boon to me, or anyone like me who does field work outdoors and has to carry around all manner of other gadgets and equipment and doesn't need a large device getting in the way or getting banged up. If you need a good reliable form of communication and also don't need it to be the center of your life, this model fits the bill.

review/text: My wife got this phone to replace her Samsung X427m that was stolen. I suggested she stick with the Samsung but she wanted something different. She got this phone off of Ebay for $50.Even at $50 this phone is not worth the money. The phone's problem is that the reception absolutely sucks! I am lucky to get 2 bars in my own house using this phone!! Whenever she calls me on my cell or landline phone, the call drops after 5 minutes or so. Its not my cell phone because my SE T637 always has at least 4 bars where ever I go. As a matter of fact, I was just on the phone with her and the call dropped for the 3rd time in 10 minutes. I have been trying to call her back, but the call won't go through.This phone reminds me of the nightmares of MetroPCS' pitiful coverage. But the problem here is not Cingular service, its the phone! I can't believe Cingular would allow their name to be branded on this piece of garbage.LG sucks! I will never purchase another LG phone again.I will be getting my wife the Samsung X427m which we had no problems with and NO dropped calls!the only good thing about this phone is the bright screen, but what good is that if the phone doesnt work worth a crap to begin with??NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!!

review/text: It's your basic phone.It calls, it receives, and keeps a phonebook.It has one game, and the basics of calculator, memo, calendar.The graphics/wallpaper isn't that great, but it's just a cheap phone anyway.It has some cheesy ringtones, rather ridiculous actually seeing as how my friends are always laughing whenever they hear my ringtone.It has a vibrate feature, but you can only use the vibrate feature for two levels: when silent & on vibrate, or when on loudest & on vibrate. Anything in between like on level three ringer, vibrate is unavailable.The mirror on the cover is fairly useless, except for the occasions when you need a quick check for food in your teeth.Yeah, the buttons on the side push easily from vibrate feature to the maximum level, but it doesn't happen too often.Occasionally the screen stays black for 5-10 seconds when the phone is flipped open quickly, which is pretty dumb, seeing as the point of a flip phone is to "flip" open the phone quickly to view the screen. Go figure.The weight of the phone is surprising. Very light. I like the compactness and lightness of it. A big plus.The phone responds about 3-5 seconds from when you push a button. It's a little aggravating.The earpiece is rather irritating too. You always have to smash the earpiece against your ear to hear someone screaming from the other end. In turn, you must scream into the mouthpiece to have the other party hear you. And if you're wondering, it's not the service quality. I tested it with my old Nokia 3595, where I can hear perfectly fine and whisper and have the other party hear me.The battery life has been okay for the past 1 and 1/2 years I've had this phone. Sometimes the battery lasts a long time, but other times, the battery drains for no apparent reason.Regarding signal, I receive about 1/2 the signal on the LG than what I receive on my old Nokia 3595.

review/text: This phone is the worst and most expensive phone I have ever owned (I got it before it was free). It has horrible reception and it drops calls left and right especially in areas of higher density. The clarity of almost all my calls is incredibly bad. It scrathes very easily. Vibrate only works on the loudest ring or no ring (nothing's wrong with it, that's just the way the phone is) and the ring tones are very hard to hear unless you pick one of the loud annoying ones. It doesn't tell me when I have voicemail messages. Voicemail doesn't work half the time. There's no voice recorder or loud speaker. You can't see the screen in the sunlight. Speed dial is a pain because you can't press the number then the call button, you HAVE to hold the key down, which doesn't sound like much, but if you've had a phone that worked differently, it's annoying. There's no snooze on the alarm. The sim card takes forever to load when you turn on the phone. The battery life is so short if you talk a lot (Four hours talk time). I'm a college student and my phone is my main source of calls and I have to charge this phone almost every day and I have to take the phone charger with me even if I'm gone just for the weekend. I'm very unhappy with this phone. I wouldn't even get an LG again.

The volume buttons were on the side of the phone so I was always turning it down to where I couldn't here it on accident. But the worst part is having a contract with cingular. I had a problem with the voicemail so I called their service number and waited 30 min just to speak to someone and they didn't even fix the problem. And they were charging me minutes to talk to them. My husband is military and we moved to Germany, so we canceled the service before our contract was up. Now Cingular wants the phones, manuals, chargers and box back or they will charge us $250 each phone which is outragous. I of course don't have the box or manual.

review/text: I'm not someone who buys a phone on a whim. I'm too poor for that sort of extravagance. So when my last phone went kaput it became inevitable to buy a new one. I wanted something sturdy and no nonsense, but didn't look like it weighed a ton . I wanted something that didn't make me feel like I needed a degree in phone science to operate it, but also oozed technological savvy.In short, what I was looking for was something like the Sony Ericsson K800i. I fell in love with a lot of the features:1. The fun, quick camera that you could operate quickly and without a fuss2. The user friendly interface3. The fact that it could probably double as a music player if you wanted it to.4. The large screen5. The elegant design of the phone (in a stylish black, with clean design lines)and so forth.The only real sore point with me is that the phone doesn't interface with my PC as well as I had hoped it would. I don't know if it's a driver problem or whatever, but Sony really should have hammered out the connection routines a bit more before releasing this gem. A small flaw in an otherwise perfect package. I love this phone and can't think of a more fun one on the market. Buy it if you want something that is simple to use, but has bells and whistles to boot.

review/text: The Andrew Extensis is a great product! Remove the Baby Bell service from your home or business, then plug this unit into a phone jack with the cellphone in the cradle. From any phone in your home or business, including cordless phones, you can operate exactly like you always have. The benefit?? You now have all of the features, and plan advantages of your cellular phone. It is great for a small business as the owner can take the phone when they leave, or leave it in place and allow the calls to go to voice mail.There is one potential fault. To place the Nokia phone in the cradle, one sets it into the cradle with the phone vertical. After it latches, it gently leans toward the rear of the unit. I accidently broke one I had because to remove the Nokia phone without damage, you must tilt the phone to the front of the cradle before removal.My only other concern with this device...... I wish Andrew had units available for phones other than the Nokia 5100/6100 and Startac. Once these phones are no longer available, what will we do? I can hope!

It's reliable and allows me to have extension phones throughout the house rather than carrying a cellphone from room to room. Given the fact that increasing numbers of folks are using cellphones as their principal telephone (see New York Times of August 2003) it's surprising that this item has been discontinued and nobody else seems to have picked up on the concept.

(Samsung N625, X427)LG is a great manufacture, and this is one of their first GSM phones (they mostly make CDMA phones for Verizon Wireless). It is a tri-band world phone, has a large external caller-id, large screen and vibrant 65k color display, great quality camera with photo caller ID. Also, polyphonic music tones sound great on this phone and surfing the web is easy!My only complaint is the bulky appearance but I have started to get use to it. Overall, a great buy. I would reccommend this phone over any other Samsung phone that Cingular currently offers. However, if you are looking for speakerphone and bluetooth technology, go for the Motorola V600. I find LG's programming interface easier to use than Motorola's. It's a bit trickier with the Motorola V400 and V600 to navigate your menu options.

product/title: LG L1200 Phone (AT&T)
review/text: I like the heft and feel of this phone and it comes with every feature I can envision needing other than a speakerphone. The buttons are large enough to avoid accidental presses of adjacent keys. There are three, count 'em, three buttons to take pictures. That is probably overkill. This is my first LG phone and I selected it based on the feature set but also because I've been told and read on the web that the phone handles weak signals well. So far that is true.After a horrible experience with the Motorola 720 which dropped calls faster than fall leaves and an experience with Verizon's highly praised customer service that I wouldn't wish on an enemy, (Let's just say it was the worst customer service experience I've ever had. Worse than the old Compaq Computer. Worse than Packard Bell (remember them). Worst ever!) I am pleased that so far the L1200 with Cingular service works better in every part of my home and city than the 720 with Verizon.I know service varies from place to place and I am certain there are locations where Verizon is better than Cingular, but here and now I am once again experiencing what I expect from a mobile carrier- a good product and good coverage.

review/text: Upgraded from the Nokia 3650 because I wanted a camera phone. Picture quality is decent enough considering it's a phone. Reception is great, all the time. I've had this phone for two months and have dropped only one call, early on. The interface is very easy to understand.My only complaint is in regards to the ringtones. The pre-sets all suck - the polyphonic ringtones are all too quiet to hear and the full-audio tones all sound like old video game theme songs. What's worse, you can't record your own and use them, as with many other phones. You have to go to Cingular's site and shell out $2.50 apiece for twenty-second (or less) audio clips.

review/text: Everyone in my family has Motorolas (V400, V220, T720) so I was used to those and was skeptical about getting an LG. glad I did! The screen is better than my sisters V400 (it says 128x160 pixles, but looks FAR better) the keys and phone have a good, sturdy feel. The camera is awesome for a camera phone, it looks like a 2 or 3 MP camera!!!! (no, seriously) although there are 3 keys that have to do with the camera...they're not intrusive, but i think its a little overkill. While closed, you can light up the screen, see time OR date, and flip between vibrate and normal sound. VERY conveinient. The screen is bright (inside and out) the sound of ringtones and while talking is awesome. When you turn the ringing volume up its EXTREMELY LOUD, so you never have to wish it were louder. Signal is great. The included ringtones and wallpapers arent the best (there are only 4 wallpapers) but you can get some others online. all in all, GREAT phone!!!

product/title: Platinum Leather Case with Ratcheting Swivel Clip for Sidekick II
review/text: I wanted to like this case; it feels like it should be sturdier than the OEM case, and it definitely looks more professional (though I'm not convinced that it's really leather). It is tight out of the box; the sock trick works well. The latch has a couple of big metal chunks that will probably wear through the liner and destroy your screen unless you get in the habit of turning the phone around (so it's less convenient to pull it out and use it). And mine broke after about 6 weeks of fairly lightweght use; the belt clip button detached itself from the case. It looks like the only thing holding it together was a little oval of double-stick tape.OK, what do you expect for eight bucks?

review/text: This case is quite nice and feels great on your hip... but do not expect it to last you the life of the phone. I bought mine around February of 2006 and used it daily until May 2006 when the nub that attaches the case to the belt clip tore out of the leather and would not be reseated. I suppose some a hot glue gun would have made it last a bit longer, but frankly by this point it was looking "used" and was not worth repairing. I do not plan to get another as a replacement. I expect a case - even a cheapo case - to last me longer than 3 months.The best part of this case is the tight fit and the magnetic closure. Both ensure that the Sidekick II will never fall out on its own, even if the case somehow becomes inverted. I once spent the better part of the day with my case pointed open-side down and the flap open, and it was held sturdily in place. The case also protects well against the wet, and the various bumps of life.

review/text: The phone description says it is a quad band phone, but the one I received was tri-band (900/1800/1900). This international version does not work everywhere I need it to work. I have AT&T service (3G) and it works in NYC, where I work, but it did not work in upstate NY. The network in upstate NY switches from 3G to EDGE. If it had 850 band, it would have worked. The phone itself is a decent phone, but if doesn't work, it doesn't matter. Amazon's description is not accurate, so if you need a quad band phone beware of this phone. You might be better off getting a US version instead.

review/text: I purchased this phone as a replacement for my slvr L2. it has better features...camera,new sleek look,added software. i fully charged it. inserted my sim card, and everything was working fine until i tried to place a call. I found i could place calls but shortly after connecting it would drop the call. so after contacting tech support they said i needed to get a new sim card and it might fix the problem. so i drive 15 mins down the road and get a new sim card just to find out that it doesnt change anything, still having dropped calls. in the end ATT said that it was the phone and it was most likley due to the fact that it was unlocked. ill never buy a unlocked phone again. as far as the phone itsself it worked fine,however im happy that i already had a motorola charger because the one that was sent in the box with the phone was european. i ended up sending it back to mobilecity and only getting a fraction of what i paid for it, due to the dumb restocking fee. so to cut this short, make sure your service provider supports unlocked phones before purchasing!!

review/text: For use outside the United States especially in Africa, one always needs a quad band unlocked cell phone like this one. I ordered and received two of these from Amazon and shipped them to my folks in Africa. They received them with joy and they jumped into jubilation when they put in their sim card and it started working at once without ant hitch like decoding or anything like that. And they made a call from it to me here in the US. Amazing isn't it? One cousin was even crazy about the ability of the phone to receive the local FM radio transmission in Africa.So then for the L6i to be described as an "International Version", was proved right when my folks got their phone working. However for use in the US please go for the ordinary L6 without the 'i'. Hahahaaaaaa!!!For People traveling outside the US and for those who are here on a short visit if you are looking for gifts for friends and family I strongly recommend this low-priced phone with camera, internet, organizer, SD slot, and FM Radio. I bought some for my friends and they are in use right now. Please buy one or more today.

review/text: The good:The PN-300 is a PHONE. It is not a palm top computer ... it is not a camera ... it is not an Ipod ... it is not a GPS navigation system ... it is not video player ... it is not an internet access device ... it is not a media storage and playback device ... and it is not a video game player Yup, that's all good. What else? It has good reception. It has excellent voice quality. The battery life is very good, and it has all the features you need to use it as a PHONE. Like what? A one button speakerphone with good sound quality, voice dialing (the good kind which records your voice), the ability to assign individual ring tones to contacts in your phone book, and most beautiful and wonderful and best of all, THE FONT SIZE IS BIG ENOUGH THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE 15 YEARS OLD TO READ IT! The clock on the main screen is big and easy to read, and the ring on high is actually loud enough (what a concept!?) The menu and customization features are reasonably comprehensive, and include what you need. In general, this phone is easy to hear, easy to use, easy to see (relative to most others), has clear/clean voice quality, and good reception.The negative?OK, it's not perfect. Reception may not be as good as the very best out there right now. That said, reception and transmission seem as good as most that I've tried, and quite adequate. It isn't tiny. It's about the size of my (lost) LG 6100. It's an inch thick and when the stub antenna is added, 4 inches long. The front screen is difficult to read (Pantech apparently feels that pretty is far more important than functional) and though the front screen is better than most, it could be a lot better (and by that I mean it could be easier to read as opposed to being a color screen with macroscopic font and photo caller ID)What would I change? Well, since it isn't a PDA, camera, GPS, web surfer, Ipod, video game player, it seems like it could be less chunky. An internal antenna, top quality reception/transmission, and a significantly more compact package would be nice. I'd make the front screen high contrast black on white. I like to see an option for black on white display theme (the PN-300 does include a white wallpaper choice ... indicating there is at least one genius at Pantech). A choice for a larger font size and a longer list of ring tones would be useful.Conclusion: I couldn't find any user reviews on this phone, and I was a bit worried that it would be lacking in the features I've used and seen on other current phones. I'm pleasantly surprised with this phone. It is not a stripped down minimalist, make a call only, device. The local Verizon store didn't have the PN-300 and the person I asked about it suggested it was garbage. To that salesperson, who hadn't been shaving long, I'm sure it is. To someone (over 40 crowd?) who doesn't have perfect vision or hearing, and doesn't want their phone to be a tiny personal computer, the PN-300 is an easy to use full featured cell phone, and is easily comparable to most of the current crop of LGs, Motorolas, Samsungs, etc. No, wait ... since the PN-300 does not have all the stuff apparently demanded by the under 30 crowd, it's infinitely better.

I like that fact that is fits the phone perfectly; like a glove, and does not hinder usage in any way.Another plus it the fact that the case is clear. This, I don't know if it was intentional, allows for the lights to really reflect off of the case when blinking (messages, bluetooth, etc), making the phone visible and giving it a really cool effect with the top of the case glowing in low to no light situations.The case feels nice on the phone and does not hinder putting the phone in your pocket or anything like that.I don't use the clip that came with the case because I am not one who clips my phone on my belt, but if used, it may be a tad uncomfortable as it is pretty big.

(but just barely--it was the right shape and almost the right size) after 25 minutes of attempting to get the case to fit, I got it on. Then I realized I'd left all these finger prints on the phone trying to get the case on. I wanted to take off the case and clean it but it would not come off.Finally I got it off and it snapped in the process... I tried repairing with superglue but that made part of the case opaque. Ultimately I threw the whole thing in the trash can.This case is a waste of your money. I strongly advise against buying it.

review/text: I am very pleased with this Blackberry case. It came without the belt clip attached, which was perfect as I didn't have to fight to remove it. And, being that it is clear, I can still "enjoy" having a red phone! A good buy all around!

review/text: This was a nice case at first. It looks nice and protects what it covers. After two weeks the case broke where it clips together, as if the phone was too big for the case. It's the right model for it and everything. I noticed under the case started to slightly scratch the phone as well. I was disapointed but then again, it wasn't an expensive loss. I'm now looking for a better case.

review/text: It was ok for the first month but after, the clips that attach the two pieces together start to break. It is really annoying as you need to take it off to clean the phone and it seems every time I do a piece comes off. You get what you pay for. If you are looking for something that will last for longer than a month I would suggest looking elsewhere.

review/text: This product is certainly durable and it has protected my phone which is what I bought it for. Unfortunately though removing it isn't easy and getting it off hurts a bit. It needs to be removed regularly to get the dust out that collects around the inside of the case from being in your bag or pocket. It would be GREAT if it still fit in a case after putting it on so that you could have the option if you wanted it to.But I'll take durability over a clean phone usually... if I HAVE to.

review/text: I don't like the plastic belt clip but the clear cover is all I wanted anyway. By the way, you can take the plastic knob off. You just need a really small screw driver (like the kind you use to fix your glasses). The first day I put it on my Pearl, I dropped it. Not even a scratch on the cover. And for an unexpected bonus, the indicator light reflects off the clear plastic to make it easier to see if I have any messages or alerts.

review/text: The case for this model looks great in the picture, but mine was scratched and looked bad after putting it on my phone. I originally wanted to preserve the stylish black of my new pearl, but this case did not do that for me. The clip on the back also broke after a few weeks time. Also, dust will definitely get between the clip and your phone if keep it in your pocket.EforceCity offered to replace the product or provide me a refund if I changed the review, but this product was only a few bucks so I'd rather post an honest review of the product and deal with the faults of this product.This thing is still on my phone after 4 months, but only because I am prone to dropping it when I go out.Spend money on a better case or a scratch resistant clear adhesive for the display of your phone (which I also purchased).

review/text: For a cent, why not? You pay for it in shipping, but where don't you pay shipping these days? The case fits around the phone. The only problem I have with it is that it doesn't feel snug, and the plastic seems cheap; but it actually is. the knob in the back is at times awkward, and i don't use the belt clip. But mainly, I know the case will protect my phone when i inevitably drop it. I have one for my iPod too, and it certainly protected that. RECOMMENDED!

The side on the front right have been detached and now I can see the cardboard. The flap that "keeps it in place" is now tearing (just the sides). The front left side is tearing off and that is all I notice.

review/text: I got this case for my husband about 3 weeks ago and it has worked great! The case has a good bit of padding all around which makes it very protective. We didn't use the clip included because he prefers to have it in his pocket so I don't know how the clip actually works.The only setbacks to this product is that he has to take the case out to charge it on his iphone dock we have because the case is too thick for this, but I'm sure that if you have different accessories it may not be an issue for you. Next setback is the fact that the edges on the front of the case make it a bit hard to reach the keys at the edge when typing.But I am willing to sacrifice a little bit (very little) of easiness in order to avoid accidents!I am definitely recommending this product!

If after two weeks we don't ship your order, then may can opt to cancel it." Those aren't the exact words, but it was something to that effect. Also, I had already paid for priority shipping, which I did not receive and did not get reimbursed for. This was one of the three items on my ticket. The other items were not important and shipped fairly fast. The BlackBerry battery that I ordered on a priority basis, was critically important, and didn't arrive for about two weeks. While Amazon has been good to me over the years, this was a frustrating and disappointing experience.

review/text: I ordered a battery for a blackberry on October 30th. It didnt arrive by the estimated delivery time, so I emailed, and they asked me to wait until the following Monday. So I did, and still no battery! So I emailed again, and all they told me was that they have no control over the USPS, and would send me a new one. So now, I have to wait another 2.5 weeks to maybe not receive a battery again!Since I received the battery from the seller, I have had email after email demanding I remove this negative feedback from their site. I am NOT going to do this. They have badgered me over and over to remove it or, and I quote, "We've only just begun Steve. If you refuse to act with even a shred of decency or honor, I will make sure you regret it. Remove the negative tonight." This is the very email I received from SellPhoneStop customer service last night. I could be wrong, but why in the world would I remove my honest opinion if I believe I was given poor customer service?? Obviously, they are beginning to threaten me for my opinion. They really DO NOT care about their customers!! I will never, EVER, order from this company again, and I hope anyone who reads this, won't order from then either.

review/text: I purchased 2 of these. First of all, the product image is wrong, because the image on Amazon clearly shows the BlackBerry logo, and the batteries I got are unmarked and with no logo or mention of the word BlackBerry.I could have gotten over that if the battery actually worked . . .The batteries are refurbished, and not new. (They were not sealed in plastic.) I put in the first battery, turned off my phone, and charged it overnight. The next day I unplugged it and carried the phone around as usual. By night (about 14 hours later), the battery was dead. Note that I did not make a single phone call that day. The phone was on Standby, and it died in 14 hours! My old battery was almost as good!Anyway, I bought two of them, as I said. The second one seems to be holding its charge somewhat, but I can see that the battery life indicator is already down to 75% after 10 hours of ZERO usage (all on standby).As far as I'm concerned, I was cheated into thinking the following (neither of which are true):1 - I was buying an original BlackBerry product (Note: I have complained about the image to Amazon, so I expect they will take action on this soon)2 - I was buying a new batteryI paid about $10 in total for these two batteries, and my time is more valuable than repackaging these and sending them back. My guess is that the seller is counting on exactly this psychology--that most of us will get annoyed for a couple of hours, and then realize that its not worth the time or attention.Well done, Mr & Mrs Fake-Battery-Seller. You got my money, but it's worth the 10 bucks for me to know never to go near you guys again.

review/text: Works just like the one that comes with the 8800, 'cause it *is* the one that comes with the 8800. It would be nice if it had a higher power density (which is achievable using current technology) so that the 8800 would last a bit longer between charges. High capacity batteries are available (sadly, not at Amazon) but make the 8800 thicker with the included replacement back shell.

review/text: I specifically clicked on the "new" battery to purchase. I received the 1st battery and it was dead. Called the company without hesitation they said they would send out another. Waited another 5 days and when the next battery came in it was dead as well! I then thought it must have been the phone - I bought a new phone and took that new battery to test in my old phone. You guessed it - Worked fine! So because these guys sent out 2 bad batteries I ended up buying a new phone. Now I have 2 good phones and 1 good battery. I would recommend NOT buying a battery from this company.

review/text: Given the variance in reviews, at best, I'd say this is an unreliable product. (I saw the mixed reviews before ordering, but figured "they couldn't be that bad.")First of all, the battery was NOT a BB battery -- not as pictured nor made in Japan (it was plain silver and made in China).The battery I received wouldn't hold a charge for more than a couple of hours. I sent an e-mail complaint; was told that sometimes a given battery won't be up to snuff; and they would exchange. The second battery lasted a little longer but not even 24 hours. I gave up. I had made a bad bet. I just didn't want to bother with them any more. I used it for a couple of months -- having to charge it once or twice a day. It declined steadily and finally flat-lined this week. Ironically, I'm now using my old battery which seems brilliant compared to my recent experiences.Maybe you'll get lucky, but the odds are against you.

review/text: A few other reviewers tried to warn me the same way but I went for it anyway. Contrary to the listing as a NEW battery, this was a used battery that performed the same as the 2 year old battery that came with my Blackberry 8830 World Edition. After 2 years, it holds a charge for about 1 day.Save your money and the hassles. Then go to a chain or big box store and hand over the cash for a (real) new battery.

review/text: When I bought my blackberry, my battery lasted for 2 days of intensive use. It went like that for a full year and then in a matter of a week or two my battery life halved, I could only get a day out of it of not so quite an intensive use. I was delighted to see that Amazon offered a new battery at what seemed a very attractive price, in comparison with what a cell store would charge. However, after using this battery that I purchased from amazon I get the same sort of medium sized day that I get with my old battery. This leads me to conclude that the vendor is recycling used batteries as new ones. It is cheap, but it is not new. If you don't have a battery at all get it. If you want to replace your old battery pay the $40 at a cell store and get the really new one.

review/text: Battery was purchased from OEM Planet. The first battery delivered was clearly used. The contacts showed excessive wear(worse than the original battery that is 3+ years old). The green sticker/label/wrapper was severely damaged and scatched through. Worse yet, the white indicator(for water exposure) had a red strip. I contacted the seller for a replacement, indicating that I wanted a new battery as advertised, and not a used one like they had provided. The replacement battery was delivered promptly. However, it too was used, but not damaged. My experience is very similar to that of other reviewers. $5 buys a used battery, not a new one. I will not be purchasing anything from this seller again.

review/text: I did not do a scientific study, but I don't think the new battery that I received holds more or longer charge than my worn out 3 1/2 year old battery. When I got the battery it looked a bit beat. I called and they assured me that it is new. The person said that the batteries ship bulk in a bag and they get beat up. I'm not thrilled with the performance. I am skeptical and will not do it again. Cannot recommend it.

review/text: I purchased this item from WIRELESS UNLIMITED in Texas. Although it is being sold as a new OEM Blackberry battery, allegedly the same as what comes with one's Blackberry, I don't think it is. Why? First of all, my Blackberry is only 4 months old, and its original battery is marked "Made in Japan." While this battery at first glance has the same label (quite easy to fake, of course), it is actually marked "Made in China." Another subtle difference is that the OEM battery that came with my Blackberry listed its milliamps (if I recall, 1400 mA). This battery has no designation at all of its amp rating. Now considering that the real thing costs $40-$50 at most cellular retail stores, and this item was one-seventh the price, what can I expect? Still, there is the little matter of false advertising...they are calling this genuine OEM. The "made in China" label, the lack of a retail package (it arrived in a little plastic pouch, unmarked), and most importantly, the inferior performance, all suggest FRAUD. Also -- they charged me [...] shipping and handling even though it was sent 1st class in a tiny envelope at a cost of about [...] at most. I would not trust this seller again.

review/text: The battery worked fine, for a while. But within a month of purchase the connection plate quite literally split off from the battery and rendered it useless. Granted I use two batteries (to allow complete discharge/recharge cycling) so they're pulled in and out of my phone often, but the original battery is still going strong and this one fell apart.Truth be told I probably got my money's worth out of this battery and you probably will to, but don't expect that $5 to get you very far.

review/text: I'm gonna be the contrarian amidst the 4- and 5-star reviews. This stand works beautifully in the beginning but over time my Blackberry Curve keeps slipping off. The problem is the fold in the leather that holds the BB up at an angle becomes soft and yield to the weight of the BB and therefore no longer holds it in place. They should have put some kind of stiffener.

review/text: First off, I like the stand and would buy it again. Its just not what I initially expected. My expectation from the pictures was this stand was rigid, but its not. When I received the order, I was really confused. It was delivered in a flat mail envelope. I was wondering if they sent me the correct item. After opening the package, the stand was flat and needed to be folded at the creases. Once folded correctly, 2 internal magnets keep the stand from unfolding. The only issue I have is my 8310 doesn't fit as snug in the stand as I would like. But it doesn't fall out. Other than that, the construction and quality are top notch.

review/text: So I was looking for a stand for my desk at work, I was really tired on laying my BlackBerry down & having it lost in a pile of papers or since I have a "work" setting not knowing who was calling until I picked up the phone. This seemed to fit the bill & the price was right so I went for it. SO glad I did! It's perfect for what I wanted, a simple yet nice stand that keeps my BB upright at a good angle & the best part is that it will hold it while it's in the silicone sleeve! It's made of a nice leather & magnet system so if you need to travel with it, it will hardly take up any room at all, it folds totally flat. It even has "BlackBerry" imprinted across the front, something I hadn't noticed when I ordered it, it's a nice touch. It also has 2 holes in the back flap, I'm guessing it's so you can thread the charging cord through to keep it neat. If you're looking for a subtle phone holder that will look good on probably any desk I'd highly recommend this one.

product/title: Mustek MBT-H120 Bluetooth Headset
review/text: I have used my Mustek Bluetooth headset with my laptop for VoIP calls without any problem on the part of the headset. I use Skype for calls, and once my B.T. preferences were configured, the Skype program allowed me to select my headset for both audio input and output. I use it infrequently (15 min. calls every few days) and have not needed to recharge it YET. This may not be standard for everyone but it is a good product to keep around as it is very useful with my calling situation.It is suprisingly light and fits comfortably on the ear with no discomfort after a few minutes use. The user guide is easy to understand and makes set-up very simple.I would recommend this headset without reservation as this product is not a big name in phone gear, but provides very good service for the price. The sound quality is good for all calls, but I have not paired this with a bluetooth cell phone, and have no baseline for quality. With Skype, there is a loss of quality due to Skype's limitations, but I cannot see this having much effect on call quality with a cell phone.

review/text: Not everything that I do with my mobile device is with the device in between my thumbs. A good amount of time I am in front of a computer but accessing some of the programs on my mobile for a quick reference. It is then that the JAVOedge Cradle for the Treo 680/750 comes in handy.In addition to just propping up the Treo so that I can see when a call comes in, just being able to sync my mobile easily is a lifesaver.The angle of the JAVOedge cradle is good enough to almost be a second working screen. The other thing that makes the cradle nice to work with is just sitting my mobiles off to side but within earshot of an alarm.Of course, the blue light on the cradle is a bit intense, but overall, its a simple and elegant accessory in those times when I am on the go in terms of letting me know my device is being topped of for the next mobile run.And even if you don't ever take this cradle out of your house, it is a better option than just the cables your Treo came with.

review/text: I bought this for my Treo 700p. When new, it looks reasonable. The material is worn down in some areas after 3 months of use. I didn't need the pocket inside for memory cards but the button has scratched my Treo right on the Treo logo. It is disappointing to buy a device for hundreds of dollars then to have a cheap case scratch it. I flipped my phone around in the case so it is now scratching the back.The belt clip is a sturdy and strong pinching type clip. It does not clip around a belt but it has not popped off of my belt yet. The strong pinching type has scratched my belts (since pinches so firmly) and has pulled apart the material of one belt. I prefer clips that reach around a belt to clip and hold the pouch in place.I will probably look for a better case for my Treo. Overall I can't recommend this case.Unfortunately most cases are poorly made and break easily. My search will not be easy.

product/title: Premium Horizontal Leather Pouch for PalmOne Treo 650, 600, 700, BlackBerry 7100
review/text: This case appears to be identical to ones sold by Wireless Emporium and AccessoryOne. It also appears virtually identical to the widely lauded Smart Phone Experts P6 case, although it is not clear to me whether the original P6 case had the snap-down interior flap behind which two SD cards may be stored.First things first. The case that I have (and thus, most likely all of the very similar cases I mentioned) is definitely NOT real leather. I am an analytical chemist, so I used reflection IR spectroscopy to determine that the case (including the material wrapping the clip) is actually a polyurethane-based imitation leather. Having said that, the case looks nice and I wasn't expecting real leather in this price range anyway. [Edit: after three months of daily use the case is now showing significant wear at some of the corners (making it obvious that it is actually imitation leather).]I had several concerns about the functionality of this case, but so far I am very happy with it. Here they are:Concern 1: The magnetic flap might come open too easily if snagged on something. First, the two magnets are pretty strong. Second, the receiving surface is recessed a bit, so the flap doesn't stick out very much. Third (and this was a pleasant surprise), the flap springs back closed by itself, especially while it's on your belt--it is actually difficult to force the case to remain in an open position.Concern 2: My Treo (I have a 700wx) might fall out too easily. The case turns out to be fairly snug, with short elastic strips on the sides. I'm not yet sure, but it looks like the elastic might also have enough give to accomodate egrips. I definitely like having access to my "naked" Treo. Having the Treo get knocked out of the case is still a theoretical risk, but I think I am much more likely to simply drop it. It is fairly easy to retrieve the 700 from the case without bumping anything I don't want to, but I'd bet this is not true for the 680 or any other model without a protruding antenna.Concern 3: The interior snaps might scratch my Treo. The snaps are actually plastic and their faces are quite flat. Whether I insert the phone with the screen facing in or out, I have not yet noticed a problem. [Edit: after three months of use with the phone facing inward most of this time, there is now indeed a scuff just to the left of the speaker that appears to have come from the snap. Despite this, I still prefer to keep the phone facing in.]Concern 4: The magnets might cause data loss. (Actually, this was never a concern of mine, but I have heard others voice it.) No problem to report. I routinely handle electronics items near much stronger magnetic fields in lab and I have never had a problem. (Credit cards are another story, however....)Concern 5: The magnets might get pressed into the screen and crack it. The front of the case and the flap actually feel like they have fairly rigid plastic sheets sewn inside, and the magnets themselves are very flat. With the flap closed there are thus several plies of material between the phone and the outside world. No case is bulletproof, but I feel like this one does a more than adequate job of protecting my Treo, without adding any new risks due to poor design.Concern 6: The clip might come off my belt. Not a problem--it's very stiff. So stiff, in fact, that it takes a little practice to easily slide it over your belt. Also, it doesn't scratch my belts like clamp-style belt clips did (although we'll see how long the imitation leather covering the clip holds up....)Concern 7: I might not like a fixed (non-rotating) clip. The funny thing is that the generic box mine came in has a sticker on it saying "Premium Horizontal Fitted Pouch w/ Ratcheting Swivel for Palm TREO 650 700w." Nope--but neither was I expecting one from the product description on this page. It turns out that I wore my prior swivel case in the horizontal position most of the time anyway, and this case sits much closer to my body. It is harder to remove the case completely from my belt (because the clip is so stiff), but this is getting easier with practice.Concern 8: Poor access to connections. You can easily access the headphone jack whether the screen is facing in or out. Either orientation allows access to the volume buttons (after opening the flap) if you want to listen to MP3s. (However, there is no way to conveniently access the 700wx's WMP Play/Pause button, nor to reassign this function to the side button. The best you can do is reassign it to the "Q" or "A" button, which will be just accessible with the phone in the case, at least with the screen facing out.) However, you cannot charge the phone, connect the synch cable, or access the ringer on/off switch while it is in the case.I hope this helps. This is definitely the best case for my needs, and it was inexpensive to boot! Four of five stars.

review/text: I have had this for about 2 months and and love the case and it seems to be holding up to my rough treatment, however about 2 weeks into owning it, I realized there was a scuff mark on my Treo starting to form. It is right near the ear-piece, I thought I may have dropped the phone or something, but over the next few weeks it began to get worse, I finally realized that it lined up perfectly with the snaps that are inside of this case covering small pockets for caring items. After noticing this I began putting the phone in with the screen facing out, and the antenna pointing forward, does not appear to be making a scuff mark on the back of the phone.Overall a well constructed case, but if you are concerned about the appearance of your Treo make sure you put it in with screen facing out.

review/text: I've had it for a few months now and find that the interior rivets rub a spot on the back of the cell phone. The phone can also be turned on by itself or perform other actions because the holster side of the opening flap has a seam that transcends the key pad buttons, including the hot keys and when sitting in a car the seat belt buckle pushes on the phone case and the seam causes the phone to sometimes turn on and perform some random programs. Dangerous for contact lists etc. I have a few pictures of the inside of the phone case also.Phone can also be propelled out of the case with little force if the correct angle of bump is directed on the antenna while walking. The flap will pop open.I need to get another case.

review/text: I owned this leather pouch holder for my Treo 650 for a full 2 months before the pouch fell apart completely, rendering it useless. The pouch is two separate components glued: the first part is the pouch itself, and the second part is the belt clip. After being happy with my product for 2 months, it spontaneously (not gradually) came apart where the belt clip is inserted into the pouch. A person walking behind me pointed out that my pouch and phone were on the floor; I looked down at my belt to see that the belt clip was still there. This is a great, space-saving way to store the phone, and I can't say that other pouches have the same defect, but the specific pouch that I purchased was of very poor quality, and almost resulted in me losing the very sensitive information contained on my Treo.

review/text: I am very much impressed with the quality of the Leather Pouch from my new Treo . I was very happy of the same . However While traveling as it was hooked to my trouser , my Treo fell down twice from this Pouch . As it does not have a Locking Facility , It creates a Problem . It has just a Magnetic flap which is of no use when your Expensive Treo Falls down Twice and has a Lot of Scratches on them . Hence if they would only have a Locking facility on the Flap it would be great.

review/text: I have tried several models of pouches for my Treo, and this one beats all the others hands down. Other models have serious safety issues for the phone tends to fall out or the clip breaks or loosens. Others are bulky and unconfortable and others are difficult to use with one hand. This model I like because it keeps the phone well protected, it is easy to retrieve it with one hand and to put it back in. It is also well constructed, the leather is both good looking and durable, and the belt clip is very sturdy and durable as well. I have owned all other models, including the hard case, and this is by far the one I prefer. Highly recomended.

review/text: This is the basic "attach to your belt" case for a palm treo shaped device.One complaint is that it can come off your belt fairly easily. My palm has not yet broken when this happens, nor has it dropped into water or snow. But the potential is there. So you need to be careful when wearing it.The second complaint is that the case provides no protection for your stylus. My stylus has fell from the palm several times now. So far it fell in my home or office, where I later located it. But eventually it will fall while "out in the world" and that will be it.For the price paid, not bad. But it's nothing special.

review/text: I owned one of these previously, and was very happy with it. It lasted about eighteen months before the leather around the clip finally began to tear, making the clip's hold on the case tenuous at best. So I gladly bought a replacement.At first glance, the new pouch looks the same. The problem with the clip tearing away from the pouch has been addressed - that part of the case has been reworked and reinforced with a thicker piece of leather - you can now slide the case onto your belt instead of clipping it to your belt.The case seems a little larger that the original - My Treo seems to slide a little from front to back. The interior of the case still has a snapped cover concealing storage compartments for three memory cards. In effect, the case is functionally the same as the original one I had.But you know, I finally figured out why I don't like it. It seems cheaper that the original one. The interior is made out of some kind of fabric and there's a puffy feel to the leather exterior, almost as if the leather is sown on top of a cushion. The original one seems more expensive, more luxurious, by comparison.In short, the case is functional, but its not as good as the original version of this product was. However, ots still better than anything else I've found on the market to date.

review/text: I bought the Jabra for the express purpose of using it while my phone was 15-20 feet away on my desk. I experienced heavy static from that distance (despite an advertised 30 foot range). Also, when the side of my head with the Jabra on it was facing the phone, I got better reception than when I turned away. I am, apparently, thick headed.Using the Jabra in the car was an awesome experience, since the phone was so close to me. There were no wires to interfere with my driving, and I could answer calls easily with the Jabra itself, never even touching the phone.But $80 is too much to pay for wireless convenience in a car. Until the technology improves or price drops, the Jabra is just not as vaulable as a simple wired handsfree device. I returned my Jabra after one week.

review/text: I bought this headset because I used corded earplugs a lot with previous cell phones. But when I bought a new bluetooth cell phone (Sony-Ericsson T610), I bought this because Amazon was offering what sounded like a great deal.Unfortunately, it was a waste of money because I never use the thing. The reasons:1) It doesn't fit my ear (it's too small or maybe just not suited to my ear--it's uncomfortable and always feels like it's going to fall off). The earbud doesn't really get close enough to my ear canal, so even at max volume, the sound is soft, which is OK in a quiet office, but not in a car or outdoors.2) Since it's so uncomfortable, I didn't want to wear it continuously all day long, but if you have the headset linked to the phone, the headset is the ONLY way to answer the cell phone (at least that's how it is with my T610). I had a situation where the phone rang, I hit "answer" on the phone and couldn't hear anything through the phone because I had enabled bluetooth. I had to scramble to find the headset. (Since it's wireless, it's hard to see quickly if headset is connected or not.) Enabling/disabling the bluetooth connection is a multi-step process, so it's hard to do in a hurry (with a corded headset, you can quickly just unplug the thing). So since the choice is between ALWAYS using the headset or NEVER using the headset (since disabling and re-enabling bluetooth is a hassle, and you have to remember whether it's on or off to know how to answer the phone), I've chosen to NEVER use it.3) The buttons on the headset mean you can't see them while you use them. There are two multi-functional buttons that are nearly identical in size and shape. Pushing a button briefly does something different from pushing it in longer. So it's easy to hang up on a person when you really want to just mute them. If you use it all the time, I suppose pushing buttons by feel will become natural and so will remembering how long to push each button to do what you want it to do, but beginners and occasional users will probably make a lot of mistakes, as I did.

My only real complaints are that I wish it would only pick up when I use the button on the headset, not the phone body; and that the sound is a bit muddy, though not terrible. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the T616 and my headphones, but I'd really like a bit more treble. Also, the blue LED can be a bit obnoxious, but that's covered easily with some electrical tape.

The online FAQ page is useless and the company says (online and while you are waiting on the phone for customer support) that email is the quickest option. Jabra says they answer your email within 1-2 hours. That hasn't happened for me yet. The first email never got answered and the second got answered a day later without an response to my actual question.Even the technician on the phone said they have difficulties interpreting email questions. They have very courteous and knowledgable technical assistance reps on the phones.I like the headset.

review/text: The only reason I gave this tiny instrument a 4* rather than a 5* is because of the easy falling nature of this headset. It does not fit tightly onto the ear but just sits loosely on the ear making you feel that it might fall of any time , but not so the case majority of the times.Other than this I have absolutely nothing to complain about. It paired easily with my 6620. The voice and sound clarity is the best you can find. On one instance the person on the other side of the line did indicate the sound clarity was much better when paired with the headset rather than directly talking on the phone . Astonishing !Also the 6620 does give a indicator showing if the bluetooth headset is attached, so when you do press the answer button on the phone, you can expect your your headset to take control. The answer button is on the top of the headset which is satisfactory taking into consideration that its a wireless headset and given the volume control button, there hardly any place to place the answer button. No complains about that. The battery does drain but not as quickly as some have mentioned in their reviews.Looking at some of the neagtive reviews earlier I was very sceptical on buying this, but this headset has proved itself. It does however eat a lot of battery power of the mobile when talking, but that is common for all bluetooth headsets.Previously I did own a Motorola Headset and this one has just proved its a much better headset than any other there in the market.All in all this is a very good headset for the said price.

review/text: I've had this headset for about a month now and at first I was very satisfied. I like the shape, it's comfortable enough to wear all day (and I wear it from 7:30 a.m. to about 9:00 p.m.), and the battery lasts almost forever. The headset loads into the charger like a knife into its sheath. The charger even has an accessory belt clip so you can carry it with you as a holster for the headset. The sound is loud and clear unless you drive with your windows down, and the ear gel can be adjusted to put the sound right where you want it. So why 4 stars?My only complaint is that aside from being wearable on either ear, this headset is totally NOT adjustable. Perhaps the shape of my face and/or ear is unusual, but the earpiece keeps pulling away from my ear. Add to that the fact that the headset wants to work itself off my ear entirely, and the lack of adjustability is a problem for me. Lest anyone wonder, I'm not a small person and my ears sit stylishly flat against my head.I solved the foregoing problems by cutting a heavy duty paperclip to length, bending it into the appropriate shape, and taping it to the headset with electrician's tape. Then I bent the wire so that the earpiece fits snugly into my ear. As a bonus, the tape adds a little extra bulk around the upper loop of the headset, which helps hold everything in place. Problem solved, but why not engineer some adjustibility in during design?I'd still buy it, no problem there, but I can't give it five stars because the lack of built-in adjustibility is, to me, a definite oversight.

The profile is also much lower-key, it's still noticeable, but not as obnoxious as others.I charge it every night, alongside my Sony K700i phone, and haven't had a problem with battery life. I use it regularly on my 120-mile roundtrip commute.One warning... I've actually purchase three of these because I broke the first two. The product seems very flexible, but don't try to stretch or pull them too far or you'll damage them. Don't let your two-year old kids do that either.

review/text: I've dropped it, stepped on it, laundered it, put it in the dryer, etc. etc. The thing still works. I'm amazed and impressed. (I've also lost it twice...once for over a month and a half. This thing is resilient.)Putting it on quickly enough to answer a call can be tricky, but walking around with it on all day evokes stares from both IT techies and soccer moms alike. Sound quality is solid.I use mine with a BlackBerry 7290, and I love it.

review/text: Before buying this headset, I tried on practically every other headset on the market. None of them would stay on my ear. I have a small head and small ears, and I wanted something low profile that would stay on while I was walking. This headset is nice and snug and works great. I highly recommend it to anyone who has trouble finding headsets that fit.

review/text: I tried two other Bluetooth headsets before this one. Both of the prior ones didn't fit right, were hard to hear, and provided poor voice quality (despite being made by a major vendor). I was about to give up after multiple trips to BestBuy, and decided to give Amazon a try (since the local BestBuys were out of Jabra products -- and now I see why). The Jabra arrived, and saved the day! It charged right up in its cool cradle, matched with the phone (Treo 650) immediately, and fit beautifully. It's lightweight, you can hear the people you're calling, and you sound great to them. I'm very impressed by the design (fit, form factor, buttons, charger) and utility. What a find!

review/text: The FreeSpeak is no doubt a reasonably good performer. The sound on it is reasonably clear and the microphone does a good job too. My only complaint on it is that once I paired mine and turn the kit on, my PDA (a Sony Clie PEG-UX50) would no longer be able to connect to the phone (a SonyEricsson T610) via bluetooth unless the kit is switched back off. Could be a flaw with either the phone's design and/or the Bluetooth specification (I never really did test it with a different phone to verify the problem), but since I am able to receive calls while my PDA is connected to the internet (I have GPRS enabled on my line), it would be nice to be able to answer a call without either talking on my phone or taking the PDA offline. Still, a good starter kit if you don't have any other Bluetooth device paired with your phone.Update: Well, I've managed to get a Motorola V600 and tried the same headset on it, and the same problem persists- you can't connect other Bluetooth devices to the phone while the headset is connected. I am now also fairly certain that the problem is with Bluetooth's specifications as I was unable to exchange pictures between the phones while the PDA was accessing one of the phones. So, okay. No fault of the phones, PDA or the headset. Just the way Bluetooth works in general.

review/text: Very comfortable and fits well, very light-weight, good battery life, great sound quality and volume on both ends of the conversation (unless too windy). I only have one complaint when using the BT250 with my Motorola v551 phone: Every time I turn on the headset to establish the [already paired] link with my phone, the phone immediately goes into voice-dialing mode (i.e., "Say name now ... say name louder"). Because I usually don't say anything when it does this, the normal harmless result is "Voice name not found," but a few times my phone somehow matched my silence with one of my recorded voice tags, and I found myself disconnecting a call I didn't want to make in the first place.This did not happen when I used my v551 with a Logitech bluetooth headset (which did not fit me well, causing me not to be able to hear the speaker most of the time).Jabra support first told me to pair the headset to the phone again, this time using the alternate method for phones that support the hands-free profile. This did result in a few enhanced features, but it didn't stop the unwanted voice-dialing. My next email from Jabra support said that this "is normal behavior when you hold the answer/end button on the headset," and they suggested that I either turn voice dialing off on my phone, or use the phone (instead of the headset) to disconnect the link between the two units. Well, there is only one place I can find on the v551 for turning off voice dialing (under the "headset" options), but this doesn't stop the irritating problem. Using the phone to disconnect and re-establish the link is much less convenient. It DOES stop the problem, however, but only if the headset remains turned on (but disconnected) the whole time, adversely affecting battery life. If I disconnect using the phone, then turn the headset off, the voice-dialing thing will happen when I try to re-establish the link, even if I try to do it from the phone just before turning the headset on (which doesn't work anyway).I must say again, in spite of the above, this is truly a great headset. I'm pretty sure (from other reviews) that the problem I have does not affect most phones, and it is primarily just an irritant that I have grown used to, and it only occurs once each time I turn the headset on in order to establish the link.

I send it back for warranty and it took them 4 weeks and with great hassel with their customer service before they sent out a replacement. Then when I receive the replacement unit and use it for a week, it cracked at the exact same place. I figure it is just poor design flaw. I use crazy glue and glue it back together and it hold but all my friend complain about the static and noise interfearance when I use it.

review/text: My wife wanted one of the new Bluetooth phones, and of course that meant her hands free car kit would no longer work. So the choice was to buy her a cordless hands free headset or another several hundred to install a new car kit. After a protracted review process, I chose the Jabra 250 as it seemed to be the most comfortable to wear and it seemed to have the best volume incoming and outgoing as well from what we looked at on the market, even though it is only using Bluetooth 1.1. Now that we bought it, I'm blown away, this unit is truly amazing. We are using it on the new Moto MPx 220 and it works like a champ. You hardly notice that you are even wearing it, and it has enough incoming volume to blow you away if you don't turn it down. Outgoing volume is good as well. The unit would have received a 5 star rating if it was using Bluetooth 1.2. What I have determined after reading many reviews that were great and those that said the unit was not very good, is that I tend to believe it has to do with the phone it is matched up to. A new high quality phone should work great with this as it does for us. Hope this helps and thanks for all the reviews I was able to read to get me to this point.

review/text: I bought 2 of these headsets (one for me and one for the girlfriend) on recommendation by my Cingular sales guy. It was either the BT250 for $80 or the Moto HS810 for $99.Not knowing too much about Bluetooth headsets at the time, I opted for the BT250. Two weeks later and I'm giddy like a kid in a candy store.It took a while to figure out how to install the headset to your ear, but I'm sure most, if not all, Bluetooth headsets share the same minor inconvenience. The other minor inconvenience are the buttons; they don't have a nice feel when you push them and the locations are sometimes tricky.If it's one thing I would REALLY like, then it's a replaceable [rechargeable] battery. I'd really hate to buy a new headset just because the battery will no longer hold a charge.Regardless, I have found the BT250 to be a better value than the HS810.

review/text: I purchased the 250 device for my new Treo 650. I am very disappointed and will be packing it up to send back (the Jabra...not the Treo). I've tried it for a week and can't take it anymore. The only PRO I can think of is that it is light and comfortable. I do have a lot of CONS:1. Range is supposed to be 15 feet. Yeah right...try less than 5 feet.2. If you have the phone on one side of your body (i.e. in a belt clip) with the headset on the other side, it simply does not work. I don't mean it sort of doesn't work, I mean it doesn't work at all--every time.3. When I have everything in order for it to work properly (i.e. the headset is within 2 feet of my phone on the same side of my body), the reception is spotty at best. Time and again, the person on the other end of the phone asks me if I am in a wind tunnel. At other times, they tell me that I'm fading in and out.4. About 30% of the time, the Jabra does not realize my Treo has rung. So, I end up having to not use it.5. When the Jabra does realize my Treo as rung, it takes about 5 seconds for it to realize this. As such, the Treo continues to ring. This causes me to fret...should I wait for the Jabra to realize my treo is ringing and risk losing the call to my voicemail? Or should I answer the phone. If I answer the phone prematurely (i.e. before the Jabra realizes it has rung), it takes about 3 seconds for the Jabra to connect. During this time, the person on the other end is talking and I can't hear.All in all, I considered giving this product a one-star rating.If you buy this...keep your receipt handy.

In my opinion, once paired with the device, unless turned off, it should pick up calls when they come in, but the Jabra 250, sometimes does not, or has a delayed pickup of incoming calls.I also found the set up process cumbersome.

review/text: Paired with a nokia 6230. Awesome headset. The battery life is pretty long. It feels really light on your ear and the sound is excellent.Some of these people must be going deaf or something because this thing can get loud. I never have the volume at max when I use this. And if this thing feels heavy on your ear, you must have ears the size of nickels. Or you're using two of them on the same ear...i don't know.Whenever I use this I sometimes forget I have them it until the unit rings... which makes me twitch because I'm not expecting a ring blasting thru my ear.I hate:-wind noise. You can't carry a conversation when you're driving with the windows down. or walking and the wind blowing in your face.-voice dialing may or may not work.-it makes my phone hang and reset. but that could be a phone problem in general.-30 feet? more like 10. 15 at best.

review/text: I picked up this headset the other day and I'm relatively pleased with it. Despite a few bad reviews, the sound quality is acceptable for making telephone calls and dicatation, though the sampling rate is obviously too low to listen to music with it. I easily paired it with a Sony-Ericsson t68i and my 15" Powerbook running Mac OS X 10.3.8.My quick testing with iChat AV was positive and it seems quite usable for use with an iSight for the voice portion of a call. I also was able to set the sound output to the headset and am currently listening to some music with it, but the low sample rate and the fact that it isn't in stereo makes this only a novelty. Nevertheless, it is still useful when a real pair of headphones are not available.The range, as mentioned in other reviews, isn't amazing, but was sufficient to move about an average-sized room and worked intermittently through a cinder block wall.It fit fairly comfortably on my ear and seems to easily hide, though is a bit cumbersome to put on at first. The multiple earpieces are also a plus. The dual charger/belt clip is an interesting idea, but seems to be poorly executed. It seems somewhat unstable, so I'm not sure I'd actually keep it on my belt. However, it might not be bad for riding around clipped to something inside of my backpack.All in all, it's not a bad device, though there is certainly some room for improvement. I'd probably buy it again, having used it for a little while.

review/text: I owned two versions of this unit. One with the Nokia 3650 (apparently the 3650 requires a specific type as compared to some of the other BT phones) and the second one that I currently own is with the Motorola V600.This comparison will cover both Jabra units and will compare them to the Nokia HDW-2 Blutooth adapter as well as the Motorola HS-820 bluetooth adapters.The jabra unit boasts a much better design. The other two sit on the ear and feel extremely awkward. The jabra design provides a much better and more comfortable fit even with glasses on. the other two has flimsy over the ear plastic pieces that feel very out of place.I felt this unit to be relatively easier to use as compared to the other two. I had NO problems teaming either of the units with the 3650. I did have to jump through a few hoops to team with the V600.THE most important reason I wanted a BT adapter in the first place was to due to the fact that i get a phone signal in my liviing room and there is no signal at my desk in the basement which is directly under the living room. The reception was about the same for both (not use-able). I also noticed that when I went around the corner, I would lose the signal. true for all units.All in all, I would rate each one as follows on a scale from 1 to 5:Quality : jabra-4, Nokia-3, Motorola-2.5Design: Jabra-5, Nokia-1, Motorola-1usabaility (range): Jabra-3, Nokia-3, Motorola-3usability (ease of use): Jabra-4, Nokia-3, Motorola-3Overall: Jabra-4, Nokia-2, Motorola-2One thing i did not get to test was the battery life. Jabra did provide a good two and a half days of battery time with a single charge. i did not get to test the battery life of either Nokia or Motorola units.

review/text: Strengths:This headset connects quickly to the phone, is easy to use, and reception is clear. I had a BT200 before this one. Other than the color difference, I asked what is so different? Upon making my first call with the headset, I immmediately noticed how the transfer of the call from my P900 to the BT250 was almost instantaneous. The reception and clarity of the headset is clear and the connection time is quick. The adjustment time for the user to get used to this device is minimal. Just remember to answer your call by hitting the headset power button quickly. The headset has plenty of charge time to last throughout the day.Weaknesses:One weakness is that you should not use it outside when wind is present. However, this fault is not due to the headset itself. Another weakeness is that the holder of the BT250 needs improvement. I kept the device in my pocket without losing it. Within two days of starting to use the holder with the belt clip, I almost lost the BT250. Fortunately, I was able to trace my steps to locate it outside my car. Use great caution and be aware of your BT250 if you use the holder on your belt. If you sit down, the holder can easily can easily push the BT250 loose from the holder.Summary:With this headset, you can say goodbye to wires forever. Once you have a truly wireless headset, you will not want to go back to wires. The BT250 quickly connects to the phone, is clear and static free, and is relatively simple to use. Other than the holder of this BT250, you will enjoy this headset.

review/text: No doubt Jabra is the best selling bluetooth headset these days, and for sure it's not the best bluetooth headset on the market, but have to give credit to their marketing department which is doing a good job in promoting this headset. I used to own this Jabra headset, my first impression of this headset is big and it's too obvious on the ear. Amazingly it wasn't heavy and that's good. The headset did a good job in pairing to my phone, it sounded fine, but the range is quite bad, I can't walk to far away from the phone even it said 10 meters range. I was just 2 meters away, the sound quality droped significanly. The battery life was also a problem, have to charge whenever I got a chance. Recently I found a good headset, STEP 1150, which is little known and made by a company called STEP Communications. It got a good review from PC World magazine. (...) It's a small profile headset, all day wearing comfort and long battery life. I highly recommend it.

review/text: Ounce for ounce - about a fourth of the cost of Gold.But its way2kool and works well. Star Trek like - with a bright flashing blue light behind your ear.I can hear others loud and clear.Others can hear me loud and clear - even if I talk softly (the mike is near your earlobe).Therefore - meets the base requirements. Now for other things -Its easy to lose - since it is so small.It hides behind your ears and almost disappears from view - others may think you are mad and talking to thin air.Batteries "may" be non-replaceable. No mention of this, but I have figured out how the device can be opened (there is one tiny screw) and will come to it when the batteries do die. Batteries seem to last many hours - I haven't tested exactly how long.No warning before batteries die. You can be cut off in the middle of a conversation. Some warning beeps would have been nice.I've paired it in the "enhanced" mode with the sony t610 - works just fine if you bother to read the manual and undertake enhanced pairing. You will get problems others mention if you do regular pairing. There are some glitches but those are on the phone side (I can't hear the beep before I voice dial if I am using the headset). Voice dialling does not work in a noisy environment - but that is not the headsets fault. It works well otherwise. Nothing to complain - all features mentioned work and do so well.The Sony T610 phone has very limited range with this headset. However, this is a phone issue. I also use this with a Linksys USBBT100 adapter and have absolutely no range problems - signal goes through to the furthest corner of all rooms (see my Linksys USBBT100 review).If only it would "beam me up" star trek style.

review/text: The Pros:The function and design of this headset are first rate. Right out of the box it was easy to pair with my Motorola v505 phone.It is small and unobtrusiveThe battery life is really good in standby mode, and lasts several hours of talking. (and it does issue warning tones when the battery runs low, plus the phone issues a message saying "headset signal weak - switch to handset?"The combo belt clip/charger is a really cool idea. It would have been EVEN COOLER if Jabra had made it compatible with nokia, Moto, and Ericsson phone chargers. Now I have yet ANOTHER power supply to drag with me on trips....Reception is very good as long as line of sight is unobstructed by anything full of water. I can pump gas in my car with the phone on the passenger seat or wander all over my hotel suite waving my arms wildly while the phone sits in its charging stand on the desk. If there is a body in the way (or an aquarium, etc) then the signal drops off (attenuates) dramatically. In fact, there is a marked difference between putting the phone on the opposite side of your body from the earpiece when carrying your phone in your pocket. If on the opposite side, the signal degrades noticeably.The Cons:I have been unsuccessful getting it to pair with either my laptop or my PDA however (an HP iPaq 4155).If you have a bluetooth PDA and use BT to Activesync with your PC, it will interfere with this headset while it is "connected" (from Activesync's perspective). You will hear a constant "crackling" noise that sounds like the other person is popping popcorn. It took me a while to figure out. You don't have to turn off the BT radio on the laptop or PDA, just "disconnect" the BT session temporarily while talking. This is a hassle, but not a killer (one of the reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars)My biggest problem with the unit is that it does not fit my ears without feeling very insecure. The "hanging" design always feels like it is flopping around for me, and if I lean too far to that side, the unit will actually fall off my ear. There is no way to tighten the fit of the unit; I have already tried different earpieces and positions of the earpieces, but this doesn't help. This is the reason why I will probably replace this unit with another. Its a shame, since it is such a nice unit, but the floppiness on my ears is unacceptable.BTW, I am not a midget - I am 5' 10 and weigh 160 lbs. I have a fairly narrow face, but I think the bigger issue is that I have small earlobes. If you have small earlobes (rather than pendulous ones) you may want to test fit this unit in a store before buying one here. I wish I had...

review/text: I tried this out because my old Bluetrek that I loved died. Actually, I killed it when I forgot where it was and sat on it. I was impressed with the advertised battery life, and took the plunge. Shouldn't have. While it is SUPPOSED to work in a range of 33 feet, I found that if I merely put the phone on the opposite side of my body, the connection gets fickle. You get lots of staticy noise if the phone is more than 2 feet from the earpiece and in a direct line of sight. Sort of defeats the purpose of the bluetooth technology, doesn't it? And the static is NOT just in your end; my girlfriend complained about it more than I really even heard it. So if yo get this, be prepared to anger your party on the other line. On the plus side, the sound is nice and loud in th speaker. That's about it. Try something else, like a bluetrek or motorola or something. I am trying the Motorola next. This thing is trash.

review/text: I've been using the BT250 for a couple of weeks now. Here's what I've found:1. The belt clip stinks. The device drops off it all the time. It's silly to see a $90 device sabotaged by a 15 cent piece of plastic. (It looks stupid, also.)2. The standby time is nowhere near the 240 hours Jabra advertises. I find that it gives me a low power indication after about 24 hours.3. The 250 is awkward to put on your ear, which is a real pain when you're trying to take a call.4. I've found no way to voice dial on my Blackberry 7290 with the 250.5. The distance you can be from your phone is more like 10 feet, as opposed to the 30 that Jabra advertises.6. The volume is very loud on the Jabra. I have to turn down the phone or reduce the volume using the buttons on the 250 all the time.I'd recommend the Motorola HS810 which has a good carrying case, voice dials on the 7290 with no problems, goes on more easily, and has more intelligently designed buttons.

review/text: I owned the 250v for 3 years! and if the piece that held the eargel on hadn't broken I wouldn't be in the market for a new one. This unit is great, with some inconvenient drawbacks. First, turning this thing on and off is supposed to be a matter of holding the multi-function button for 5-10 sec. Good luck with that one....I never turned it off because I couldn't. Also there is a tiny blue strobe on this thing that let's you know its on. Yeah not a great feature when its stays lit constantly while it charges on my night stand. I can't speak for its standby or talk time because I charged it nightly and had a car charger for long trips, but I never ran out of juice either. Would I buy it again?....Yep, its too comfortable to pass up.

review/text: I purchased this headset because I was having trouble hearing with the Motorola set I got with my phone. The headset was a snap to set-up, and it is extremely comfortable to wear. My old Motorola set had a tendency to flop around while the Jabra sits comfortably on my ear. Unlike the Motorola, the Jabra's speaker is designed to fit in the ear, which makes it much easier to hear. It comes with two sizes of ear gels, but even with the large gel, I have to lightly press it into my ear during a conversation in order to achieve optimum volume. It's range also seems to be a little limited, but all and all it's a marked improvement over the Motorola headset.

review/text: I bought this for my wife a while ago and pairs with her samsung slider phone (can't remember the model number off of the top of my head) quite easily. I've had occassion to use it myself (when I have to use her phone) so I feel that I can confidently rate it.Overall, it isn't too bad for a handsfree. There are times when I call her (even on a land line) and it sounds like she's digitally stuttering. In my opinion; not good. It's realatively light weight and you can wear it for a long period of time without alot of discomfort (she does wear it quite often during the day). The different ear pieces give you the ability to give a custom fit feel to it, which is nice. I've read in some of the other reviews for the bt250v (a similar model) that it has a tendency to fall off if you move your head too quickly; I can see why.Truth be told, I almost purchased one of these for my own cell phone use (I own a Motorola v360) but I read the reviews for the Plantronics Voyager PLT 510. :) I'm glad I did - but that's another review.

review/text: The headset is light and fits the ear perfectly. Unfortunately, often people have a hard time hearing me. I can hear them perfectly. I am most impressed with its durability. I forgot it in a pants pocket. The pants went through a wash and dryer. The headset still works albeit with the same problems I mentioned above.

review/text: I was really looking forward to the Bluetooth Wireless experience; however, the Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 is not all that great. With regular usage for three months with my Sony Ericsson T637, I found: a very short battery life, mediocre reception, and a shorter roaming range from my phone {suppose to be able to move 30 feet away from your phone, I couldn't get it to work beyond 7 feet}. Additionally, people would often tell me that they heard excessive static in the background and that it was hard to hear me.This technology could be great, but its a little overrated right now with the cell phone accessories that are currently available. I have had good luck with previous Jabra products and this one, the FreeSpeak, is just disappointing. Maybe I will try this again in a few years. For now, it's back to the "wired" headset.

review/text: Hello,I am a scientist in the field of Microwave/RF circuits and systems. I considered several but finally chose the Jabra A210 along with the BT250 Jabra headset. This review is for both items together.A few things to note:1) swithcing on and off is not very intuitive for the BT250, you have to hold down the power button for "n" number of seconds, the lights will flash in a certain pre-ordained sequence, but if you do hold down the power button more than what is required (this is sketchy), then the appliances enter set up mode, and the pairing between the adapter and the headset might be lost. The A210 is paired by means of a stylus pressing down a depressed switch on the body of the unit. So its pairing is not affected by the power button. BUT this set (headset and the adapter) have 8 hours talk time and 240 hours standby time (as per manufacturer's claim), even if it performs up to 80% of the reported claim, you wont have to mess around too much with the power switch. You can comfortably use it during the day and come home at night and recharge the set.2) Quality of sent and received signals. Please note: The jabra A210 has a pin which can be put in to 3 settings. Setting # 1 is for motorola phones, Setting # 3 for all other phones and Setting # 2 is for when you feel discomfort in setting # 1 or # 3. I have a LG VX 6100 NON-BLUETOOTH phone from verizon. I tested the settings extensively by calling a friend. (Thanks Guddu.) I tried setting # 1, there were 2 noticeable problems: (a) My friend complained that the volume of my voice was low, but the clarity was good.(b) I could not use the button on the head set to connect and disconnect calls.But I must mention, I could receive my friend's voice in absolutely loud and clear tones.Both the problems were alleviated when I used setting # 3 on the adapter. In fact, when I started using setting # 3, my friend complained that my voice was too loud! There werent any issues related to clarity.3) Range: The manufacturer claims this to have a range of 10 meters (30 feet). But at the same time, in its manual, it is written that if there are objects in the wireless signal path between the adapter and the headset, the sound quality will suffer.Now we have to consider 2 trade offs for every RF design. (a) power (b) size. We all want the smallest devices with maximum power and range. Well physics and electronics sharply put us back in our places. If you want greater range, you need to put out signal with great field strength. That needs higher battery consumption, high efficiency non linear amplifiers and large antennas. Microstrip patch antennas (generally used for their low profiles and small size) resonate to a particular frequency if their length is correctly defined. But with design modifications, this length can be shortened, but the gain suffers. Also, thanks to the FCC, we have very strict limitations on the frequency bands available (the higher the frequency, the shorter the wave length, and thus smaller the antenna and consequently higher the gain). FCC makes many RF devices work at lower frequencies than we RF engineers would like them to operate at. Also, due to fear of signal from one device interferring with other devices, FCC puts limits on the amount of power a device can put out.Given these considerations, the A210 and BT250 which are required to have excellent power efficiency (8 hours talk time and 240 hours stand by time) and also small and compact size (very small batteries and small antennas) provide a range which is not quite satisfactory. I walked at a radius of 10 feet and even with walls, metal partitions, etc, the signal strength was not that affected. How ever more than 10 feet, the signal had so much noise in it, I had to move closer to the adapter.To be honest with you, I am not happy with the range. I dont think the range is $130 worth (for the adapter and headset = $50 + $80). Period. For a 10 feet range the cost should have been more like $50 (for both).So basically, we have reviewed some basic factors. However, there is one major design flaw that I would like to bring to your attention. That is: The head set and the adapter enter in to stand by mode after one minute of non-usage. So even when you are in the middle of a call and both parties keep silent for more than a minute, the head set and the adapter stop communicating. The call is NOT disconnected. You can either pull the adapter jack out of the cell phone and put it back in, or press the volume key on the cell phone (basically do some thing with the cell phone) and you will be able to resume the conversation on the bluetooth devices. How ever this is not voice operable. Meaning, if the adapter and the headset enter in to stand by mode during the conversation when both parties to the call are silent, even when they both start talking, the adapter and the head set do not start communicating.This is extremely uncomfortable. If I have a blue tooth head set and adapter kit for which I have paid $130 or more, then I want absolute mobility with out any reason to come back to the adpater unless I do so from my own free will.Lastly, here is a recommendation for the people who designed this set. You need to incorporate greater features in to this adapter and head set. It should be able to not only handle voice data but also music and other types of audio information. This means you might need to use a more efficient method of modulation. Maybe you are using FSK which is constant envelope modulation (I deal with military and radar communication, so I dont know what modulation is used for blue tooth), but you cannot include too much information in to the FSK signal. Try using QAM, maybe not a very high order QAM, but some thing capable of handling all audio information. All you will need to change in the design is: a new power amplifier which is high efficiency and linear. Probably a class E or Class F with feed forward or Envelope elimination and restoration (Kahn) or Doherty principles. It is simple. You will need a one time engineering development cost, but in the long term - with market domination and mass production, it will more than make up for it.As for buyers. If you are rich, a techno geek or a business person constantly on the phone - Go for this. It is good.But if you have limited resources (money) then buy a simple wired hands free kit. In fact at times when the battery is down or I have to move to get back within range, I long for the reliability of a wired handsfree kit.Update: June 25th, 2005: By the way, I lost one A210 and recently purchased one more. I tried one more test on it recently. I got a adapter from radio shack (Part # 274-397) which accepts 3/32" submini stereo plug ( as is the plug of the A210) and fits a 1/8" mini stereo jack (as is the plug for all standard head phone jacks). Thus I connected the A210 to the adapter and connected to my new Creative MuVo MP3 player. Then put on my BT250. It worked!! I could hear the music through the blue tooth set up!BUT the music quality was poor... this blue tooth unit probably has enough sampling rate for speech, it is not able to handle the sudden and faster changes in amplitude, phase and frequency of a music signal.Nevertheless it works.Kaushik.

review/text: I've had my 250 for about three months now. While I realize this hardly makes me an expert or a Bluetooth elite, I am not that enthused with this headset.In the first place, the general feeling I get when handling it, is that it is of marginal construction and "quality" was, perhaps, sacrificed to get a unit out on the market.While I will say that it is very comfortable to wear, it fails in one major area - that of "user" volume. I am forever being told that I cannot be heard or that my audio is so low as to be almost a whisper. I didn't buy a headset so I could stand in the corner and yell into my phone; I've seen enough of these "ego heads" doing that in airports and restaurants; talking so loud as though everyone should be interested in their conversation.So I am actively looking again. Maybe the thing to do is just to wait it out and see if SOMEONE can't come up with a headset that is comfortable to wear that actually performs as it says it will.

review/text: First, I'm totally willing to plead user error (but I don't think so). I bought this item because of CNET's high marks. After successfully pairing it, I found in the manual there were special pairing instructions for my phone (T-610) to get extra features. Since re-pairing it, I no longer get a voice activation prompt and have to guess when to say my contact name.Also, the manual specifies that wireless networks will interfere with Jabra's reception and cause popping. Thank goodness there aren't any of those around! Seriously, these days every Starbucks on the planet has a wireless network up and running.But my biggest gripe is the inoperable voice dialing. I get "no match" after "no match." My guess is that the ambient noise when you record your voice names has to match up with the ambient noise when you make the handsfree call. (i.e. the interior of my car sounds different than my office or living room).Finally, my email to Jabra tech support has gone unanswered (24 hours).I'm still keeping my fingers crossed and will happily edit this review should things work out better. I'm going to try resetting and re-pairing.

review/text: I've been using my Jabra headset for a couple of weeks and have been very pleased with it. I bought it primarily for use while driving. It's very comfortable to wear. It has performed extremely well in the car. At times, I've used it at home. The range of the headset is quite good, but I get more static in my apartment. From time to time, I lose connection with my phone. I suspect that it's more a problem with my phone than with the headset...I only wish that the phone would come with a charger for the car as this is where I (and perhaps most people) will use the headset. In any case, I can highly recommend the Jabra headset.

review/text: I thought the Jabra FreeSpeak would be a much better bluetooth headset than a lot of other products on the market. Boy was I wrong! Once I got started with the headset, I heard a lot of static on my end and the people I called could barely hear anything I was saying.Heaven help you if you have an 802.11x setup at home! I have a wireless network at home which seemed to cause a lot of interference with my headset. Even when I tried the headset on the road or elsewhere, the static was unbearable. You could barely keep the headset 1 foot away from your phone before you started hearing static.I returned this puppy back to Best Buy the very next day.I have since purchased the Bluetooth headset from Logitech which works GREAT!!Note: I have a Sprint PPC-6601 phone

review/text: I have been using this device for two months, and have been generally happy with it - the audio fidelity is good, the unit is comfortable, the battery life is long and, although I haven't tested the maximum range, I usually use it at 10 to 12 feet from the phone (Nokia 6820). My house is in a marginal reception area for Cingular, and using the headset allows me to put the phone in a "sweet spot" with an unusual orientation, giving me three or four bars instead of one.The "belt clip" is a joke.

My main complaint is it is not adjustable to my ear. I actually have to use the big ear gel to get it to stay on because the part that goes over your hear is about 1 cm too high over my ear, so the big ear gel holds it up.... It fits my husband perfectly, so maybe it is that I have smaller ears, it just seems to me that there should be a better way to make it fit.

review/text: If you are one that doesn't sweat for a living or around anything loud, its not bad. Volume could be a bit better but when you begin to have a hard time hearing somebody they are already complaining about the background noise. I have a beard as some I sweat which is death for the mic. I lost two that way. The closest thing I came to for a fix was make a "dog cone" out of electrical tape. When using with the BlackBerry 7520 it disconnects several times a day without indication. In short, if you are a pencil pusher and drive you car with the windows up all the time you will love this headset the fit and feel are wonderful. If you sweat, work around semi noisey stuff, and drive with your windows open save your money. I have also tried the Scala 500 and a few of the Motorola. They all kill the ear and Scala just wasn't loud enough. I am off to try the Plantronics Voyager..

review/text: I have had thins headset for several months now and have to confess I hardly use it. I bought it for my T-Mobile telephone and while pairing was easy, when walking down the street the microphone seems to act like a wind tunnel - wind just blows straight into the microphone and no one can hear me over the combination of street noise and wind.I don't think it is a T-Mobile GSM issue although the microphones on their handsets seem to be so super sensitive that listeners often say they can hear my footsteps and the conversations of others around me better than they can hear me.Overall, not very workable and I'm disappointed. Have actually just ordered a Plantronics M3500 which boasts a noise-canceling microphone. We'll see if there is any improvement.Finally, I thought that at least I'd be able to use this headset for Skpye. It works a charm on my Mac although people say I'm faint, but on my Windows machine I am completely unable to get the sound to come out of the Jabra earpiece; only through the speakers on my computer. While that is better I think than having to listen to a telephone conversation through stereo headphones (which, incidentally, is unbearable and cuts you off from everything going on around you), it is not perfect.

review/text: This headset is not worth the money. In my case, it was not worth any money. It has a range of about the length of your arm. It does not work worth a darn outside of the car. It has a hissing sound in the background all the time. It crackles and pops most of the time. I love my Treo 650 but this headset stinks. I received this headset as a gift so it did not cost me anything yet I am still disatisfied and will be ordering a different brand. Take my advice, avoid this headset. If not, well, you were warned.Update: Recently purchased the new Treo 650 headset by PalmOne. That is the new Bluetooth 1.2 version, not the clone of this Jabra. Much, much better.

review/text: I loved the idea of wireless for the convenience and safety and was loving the Jabra until it fell apart on me. The distance from your headset to the cell was definitely short range, maybe a few feet away before it got fuzzy. What was worse is that after 4 months of owning it, the earpiece (that holds the rubber plug) broke off and the headset surface started fading. The piece breaking off meant I could not put a earplug on there and it was not covered in the warranty (the customer service suggested I super glue it!) I bought another Jabra thinking the last one was a fluke...but other things started falling apart. Very poor quality piece...I would rethink buying this product!

review/text: I bought this headset after having a Nokia HDW-2 headset for about a year, before its battery went south.Did my research, thought this one was the best of the lot.Found out I was nearly right. This is *much* better than the HDW-2. Very little static, doesn't drop calls. Haven't found the limits of the battery (yet), and I've used it in standby mode for nearly 8 hours straight. Works well with the Nokia 3650, including the voice dialing.My talk times are not that long, so I haven't stressed the talk limits yet.As to cons, the only con I've found so far is with fit. The smaller earpiece of those supplied still irritates my ear after a few hours of wearing (on the right ear). Wearing it on the left ear doesn't seem to get as raw, but the piece doesn't fit as well (yes, I've turned the ear-bead the correct way!). However, I take the piece off for a few minutes rest and I'm back in business. Or I move it to the left side for a while.Only other drawback is that I have to turn the Bt250 off before I can use my Bluetooth on my Palm Pilot with the phone. I guess its only one bluetooth device at a time.Charging is easy. Pairing with my Nokia 3650 was a snap.Is it a toy? Yes, like all technology that doesn't keep you alive, its a toy.If you want a wireless headset, I think this is the one for the moment.

review/text: I have used this headset with my Treo 650 and have been very disapointed with it's performance. It may be a function of the Treo's Bluetooth capabilities so keep that in mind and do not waste your money on this headset if you are using a Treo.It has very poor range; arm's length at best. Outdoors it is useless. It has times when it will refuse to pick up a call. The voice quality is also poor with hissing and crackling. The only place it seems to be remotely useful is in the car where it is within arm's reach and the hissing is only moderate. This is pretty expensive to only be able to use part of the time. Talk time is also much shorter than advertised.My $.02, save your money for something else.Update: Recently purchased the new Treo 650 headset by PalmOne.

review/text: I've actually got the BT200 but thought i'd leave my thoughts here anyway. I've been using this for about 18months now and have generally had no problems. I think bluetooth handsfree kits in general are worth the money over the wired ones as they give you true hands free that works (doesn't fall out of your ear when you turn your head while driving). The Jabra in particular is far better design than any others on the market at the moment because by design its more likely to fit different ear and head shapes. Also the in-ear design means you have the best chance of hearing the other party clearly. And I have never not been able to hear the other person. Setup is easy and takes about 2min. Day to day operation is simple, you just turn it on and it works.There are 2 reasons why I have only give this a 4 star rating.1) Some time it doesn't connect with my T68i after having been out of range (but to be fair I think this is more the crappy T68i than the Jabra)2) When outdoors it isn't very good at cutting out background noise so the person on the other end can't hear me verywell (NOTE: this is ONLY when i'm outdoors. Indoors or in a car while moving is perfect)One of my mates has one too so I know what its like being on the receiving end of a conversation and its fine.

review/text: I have 2 of these headsets for a Sony Ericsson t637.I second other reviewers regarding poor range. The phone has to be in line of sight, within a few feet. If the phone is in mypant pocket, reception is marginal.Also: I am unable to use it to record my voice tags. I have read other reviews compalining about this.When I am voice dialing a phone book entry with multiple numbers,I do not get any audio feedback that the phone is waiting for meto say(e.g) "home" or "work" to select one of the numbers.I find it pratically unusable for voice dialing while driving.I guess for better voice tag matching, you would have to record your voice tags in the car, using the Jabra which seems to beout (see above).Oh by the way, the phone uses battery power at a much faster ratewhen connected to the headset, i.e enabling bluetooth increasespower consumption.

review/text: SetupNokia 6820Laptop using Linksys usbbt100 adaptorWith the phone it is a nice handsfree option. In response to the guy that had such a hard time turning the bluetooth connection on and off you can just turn the unit off by holding the button for a few seconds.If your phone supports the more enhanced call management features You probably want to answer the call first since holding it down while the phone is ringing rejects the call. Then while the call is in progress it just places the call on hold and continuing to hold will turn the device off and the phone will revert to standard usage with the call on hold.Additionally many phones, especially those with Bluetooth, have the ability to define user shortcuts to phone features. One setup to minimize the hassel of connecting and disconnecting BT devices would be very handy since the BT menus are normally several menue options deep.Really though this is a headset for someone intrested in constant wear. I highly recommend getting this or any handsfree set to fit your comfort level because if in the end the fit is uncomfy your going to have a pricey doo dad.Range is less than 30 feet but that seems pretty standard for a headset phone combination. Both are trying to maximize battery life and the antennas are not optimally placed. 10 feet is a good rule of thumb unless you have a particuarly bad combination. With the Nokia 6820 I seem to have a comfortable range of about 15 feet. However with the Linksys blue tooth adaptor on my laptop I can walk all over my house and even to my mailbox. Somewhere on the order of 60-100 feet. Very handy if you are a voice chat user or want a quiet discreet source of music without wires at work that dosn't completely obscure your hearing.Also if anyone is wondering the battery is Lithium Ion polymer so there should be no concern over any memory affect if you want to charge up before a full discharge. However the battery is intenal and there does not seem to be any real option for replacement. So you can only expect a life of around 400-500 charge cycles. At once a week that is a good while. At once a day you might as well just call it a year, perhaps less. It will still be working but if you are using it that hard you will also be far more aware of the slow degredation over time.Gave it four instead of 5 for the potential problem of a short usefull life due to the battery and because the fit is not for everyone. Deffinatly something to put your hands on before laying down the money if possible.

product/title: Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 Bluetooth Headset
review/text: I have tried other bluetooth headsets: Plantronics &amp; Nokia HDW-2 but this one beats them all. It has excellent battrey life as advertised and fits in the ear perfectly. I use it while I'm at the gym on the belt even. It comes with spare ear-pieces with different sizes. The sound quality is excellent and loud. It supports advanced headset mode too. A belt clip can be attached to the charger to carry it on your belt. Price is ok too. I use it with Nokia 6600 by the way. It is right ear, left ear switchable.Other bluetooth headsets are wheather weak (the ear-hanger breaks) or have short-life batteries. So look for these factors before buying any headset.

product/title: Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 Bluetooth Headset
review/text: I just bought the Jabra BT250 and have only been using it for about a week now. It has a bit of delay when you answer or place a call but it is tolerable. I have always had a very hard time finding earphones that fit me and will stay in my ear (from cell phone earbuds to mp3 players). This fits very securly and comfortably. Easily could forget I have it on. Have only gone about 20 feet from my phone but the phone was in my car with the door closed and I walked to get the mail... I did get a bit of static but perfectly usable. Occasionally I try to place a call and the Jabra doesn't seem to make the connection and I end up using the phone itself. But this has only happened less than 5% of the calls I've made. Easy to put on with one hand...while driving.Overall I'd say good buy only negative that I see so far is the occasional time when I can't get the Jabra to click on and receive the call.

product/title: Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 Bluetooth Headset
review/text: I don't have much to say about the 250 other than to point out the really poor design of the belt clip/charger. The 250 is supposed to click into this holder (which connects to the power adaptor for charging). This holder is designed to clip onto your belt so that you can carry the 250 when is is not in use. Okay, I agree that you will look extremely nerdy if you have your phone AND your earpiece hanging from your belt but sometimes you need to put the things away and the Freespeak 250 is really too fragile to carry in your pocket. The only problem with this is that the 250 will easily fall out of the holder and if you use it you WILL lose it. It is only a matter of time. My 250 lasted about 45 seconds and when I went to get it from the belt clip it was GONE. Not the holder but the 250 itself. Some lucky stiff at the Houston airport picked it up and walked away.I also thought that the 250 was not well made. When I would push the on/off or volume buttons I could feel the housing "give" a little, as if the buttons were about to collapse into the housing. A little too flimsy and not indication of a long life expectancy for the earpiece.I suggest that you consider another alternative - at $90 the 250 is simply overpriced.

product/title: Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 Bluetooth Headset
review/text: I have read a lot of reviews for this and the Motorolla headset. While I have never used the Motorolla one I like this one better because no one notices it in my ear. The reception is great, the sound is clear, and no one has complained they couldn't hear me. I have had it for a month with no problems. The only issue I have is when I am near corless phones or wireless networks I have to hold the phone closer to the headset. However when I am at the mall or in the park I do not need to take my phone out of it's case. All in all this is a great headset.

review/text: Great product... but I bought it for my Treo 650. Jabra makes a different version which looks identical to the BT250 but is designed specifically for use with the Treo 650 and can be purchased at PalmOne's website. DO NOT BUY THE BT250 for the TREO 650. Go to www.palmone.com and buy it there - they are two different devices and the BT250 is severly limited in functionality when paired with the Treo 650.

product/title: BoxWave mini Capacitive Stylus for Apple iPad, iPad 2, and Amazon Kindle Fire (Metallic Silver)
review/text: I have used the iPad since the initial launch and absolutely love it. My main gripe has been the need to constantly clean the screen. I initially bought one of the mini stylus to try out and have since ordered a couple more for co workers. The quality is very good and the plug that fits the headphone port is perfect.My only disclaimer is that I use it as a pointer. I'm not trying to do handwriting or drawing on the iPad. It may be fine for those applications but that's not my thing. Like the iPad it is a simple design that just works.

product/title: BoxWave mini Capacitive Stylus for Apple iPad, iPad 2, and Amazon Kindle Fire (Metallic Silver)
review/text: Purchased this as my fingers are pretty large. Works ok but keep in mind it is small. I have a small lowepro camera case that holds my ipod tuch 4 and its Belkin grip edge case quite handy for active transport and protection with belt velcro loop attatchment (very secure). If I slide my ipod into the case with the stylus connected to the earjack port it fits in no problem. You CANNOT reach the entire ipod screen when this is connected to the earjack. You get most of it but for the area near the top you need to pull it out from the jack port. Somewhat of a hassle.

product/title: BoxWave mini Capacitive Stylus for Apple iPad, iPad 2, and Amazon Kindle Fire (Metallic Silver)
review/text: The product arrived quickly. I ordered this and the box wave Stylus/ink pen. My original review was 4 stars; however, in the last weeks of ownership, I've lost at least 1 black ring from each item! The small black lines you see are actually black really thin and cheap O rings. They make for a comfortable and stylish pen and mini; however, when they fall off and you lose them, it becomes an uncomfortable and ugly Stylus and min! I lost the first one of each before I even noticed the rings move easily! After being aware that I must use caution, I lost another. I'd like them to send me quiet a few spares for each item. But as it is, I can't give this product a good review. I would not order another box wave product knowing about the temporary rings!! It's upsetting!

product/title: BoxWave mini Capacitive Stylus for Apple iPad, iPad 2, and Amazon Kindle Fire (Metallic Silver)
review/text: Length:: 3:02 MinsLike itsbig brother, the Boxwave mini-stylus has a superb tip for today's capacitive touchscreens (older-style, hard styli won't work on them). In winter, when you've got gloves on -- nothing better. Also like the larger model, it attaches to your mobile device with a plug that fits in the 3.5mm audio jack. This little nub stores neatly in a small case with the phone, but its short stature makes it a bit uncomfortable for extended use: finger cramps ahoy! PDApanache and other makers offered telescoping barrels that solved the "almost-gone piece of chalk" syndrome, I'd give a fifth star if this stylus extended in length. But it's still a great tool for keeping your smartphone or tablet screen clean, and is probably more accurate than your finger for "touch typing" an on-screen. For the (current) price, I think it's a quite a bargain.

product/title: BoxWave mini Capacitive Stylus for Apple iPad, iPad 2, and Amazon Kindle Fire (Metallic Silver)
review/text: I gave one of these to my father (70) so he could let my sister (35) and mother (67)try it out on their EVO Shift phones from Sprint. About 4 months later he called me up and said he wanted 2 more ordered because he wanted to keep it for himself but both my sister and my mother also wanted it. He said it is helpful for entering information on his phone because his fingers are "large and dry" and sometimes his phone doesn't seem to know he's trying to touch things on the screen. I saw a review about it not working with the Nook Color however my mother uses hers with her Nook Color as well as her phone. She has reported no issues with it not working with her Nook. I have one and it works fine on my phone and iPad. The mini size is good for keeping it with us when we are not at home. I keep mine tucked into the case and very seldom use the ear phone port attachment. My mother and sister use the ear phone port attachment to keep it with their phones when their phones are stowed in their purses.

review/text: This s a well built stylus that helps keep your screen clean. However, have to agree with one of the other reviewers, the cord should have been elastic. You have to take it out of the hole on top to use it. I have used it on both am iPhone and iPad.

review/text: My daughter is using it for her iPad. She likes it but says that the rubber bands on it come off easily. It is definitely meant for people with small fingers. She likes how the mini stylus clicks to the iPad so she does not lose it. Overall she is definitely recommending the product to other people. It's just another cool toy for your iPad.
