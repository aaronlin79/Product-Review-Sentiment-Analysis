Jabra gels perfect solution Icon-Hero, they're heaps better original earbud-nonsense supplied bluetooth unit (which totally dig). Still, drama finding way "rig" $100 electronic device reputable manufacturer hurt ear cool. Aliph-Jawbone listening? know ears fit requirements different, I'm sayin'...really? Anyway, looking alternative problem(s) associated original, messed-up-a$$ earbuds, might already know gotta use one round earbuds like one unit new Jabra eargel fit it. Here's thing: depending size Jabra eargel use, may swap stock Jawbone ear bud.

review/text: reading reviews December (there 15-20 time), decided even though probably best Bluetooth Headset market, might best price. mostly good reviews time.So bought it. excited! loved over-the-ear thing 'cause hate things! Well, seemed good first - great functions, loved way fit rubber tail, extremely light.... actually started using - made adjustments rubber ear plug, could hear people end fine, problem always seemed complain getting bad feedback sounding like tunnel. always end taking Bluetooth using phone 5 minutes 'cause friends can't stand it.Oh well. guess moral lesson this... Bluetooth still fairly new technology lot room improvement, point way get really great Bluetooth headset pay big bucks ($75+) one latest greatest best technology. like can't afford that, probalby best waiting technology improves prices come down, because, yeah, got headset great price, since worthless, I'd better spending money something could actually use (like groceries - hehe).

Extremely lightweight, secure fit. easy forget light. soft spring easily fits ear secures it. hook type headsets, play side-to-side head movement. fits snugly ear normal movements feel loose unsecured. notice speaker piece ear hours, painful, little sore one size. generally keep headset day anyway, realized forgotten in.2. Incoming sound loud. in-ear design fit allows hear well. one headset I've used actually want full volume.3. lots ways connect conference calls. control switching headset handset headset, connecting one call buttons.4. blue talk light turns red battery low, giving visual warning.Not great:1. Lots static bluetooth connection. cellphone belt clipped left, use headset right ear. tend notice near wifi source, always. I've also noticed away wifi signals (like car). I've headset week, still trying figure 3' distance 30' BT device would much problem clear connection.2. volume loud, sound quality poor. Motorola H500 nearly loud, can't hear well noisy, sound quality much better. AX2 sounds like midrange frequencies boosted. may make voices easier hear, also sounds tinny unnatural.3. Build quality mediocre. plastic, dropped waist level onto parking lot surface. One volume buttons popped off, battery compartment half popped out, well plastic halves loosened. volume button. I'd heard others say unit breaks easily, believe might survived drop ear level.4. Headset tends echo, although know worse BT sets. Motorola echoed, quite much this. notice it, person call mention it.5. first day power on/off tone clearly audible. know happened, first day tone muted much listen closely hear unit power off.I still hunt ideal bluetooth set. try noise cancelling mics bone conduction technology next older mic technology represents leaves much desired.

review/text: I've mine year now, thought I'd offer comments.First, buy case. particularly tough phone. teenage son killed within six months. again, always tossing around dropping it. I've dropped mine too, case kept looking good.This small phone. got big fingers do, may give difficulty. buy smaller phone, one fits nicely anywhere.The display quite bright get settings right. Perversely, display best wallpaper brightness "down." turn up, washes text out.The alarm clock fine, aftermarket accessories available interfacing PC work well enough little fiddling. I've loaded MIDI files ringtones. load correctly, experiment that.The speakerphone particularly powerful user end, person talking seems hear well enough.All all, decent - outstanding - phone. I've looked others but, now, stayed little Nokia.

UI Nokias 10x better. fact still hate UI 3 years really tell something. issue alone 90% reason hate phone.- Dropped calls. Poor reception. nothing like old Nokias (which free Cingular phones.) also antenna "upgrade". Made difference ALL.- Side volume controls. used always want phone convenient volume controls side got this. pocket (or purse female) find buttons get hit time turn vibrate make phone beep. Obviously problem isnt specific phone something consider cellphone design.On plus side, phone generally always reliable. volume decent. speaker held better time Nokias (they noticable volume degradation time).Also, recently battery starting problems holding decent charge. got solid 2 years good battery/charger performance.

review/text: good:The PN-300 PHONE. palm top computer ... camera ... Ipod ... GPS navigation system ... video player ... internet access device ... media storage playback device ... video game player Yup, that's good. else? good reception. excellent voice quality. battery life good, features need use PHONE. Like what? one button speakerphone good sound quality, voice dialing (the good kind records voice), ability assign individual ring tones contacts phone book, beautiful wonderful best all, FONT SIZE BIG ENOUGH 15 YEARS OLD READ IT! clock main screen big easy read, ring high actually loud enough (what concept!?) menu customization features reasonably comprehensive, include need. general, phone easy hear, easy use, easy see (relative others), clear/clean voice quality, good reception.The negative?OK, perfect. Reception may good best right now. said, reception transmission seem good I've tried, quite adequate. tiny. size (lost) LG 6100. inch thick stub antenna added, 4 inches long. front screen difficult read (Pantech apparently feels pretty far important functional) though front screen better most, could lot better (and mean could easier read opposed color screen macroscopic font photo caller ID)What would change? Well, since PDA, camera, GPS, web surfer, Ipod, video game player, seems like could less chunky. internal antenna, top quality reception/transmission, significantly compact package would nice. I'd make front screen high contrast black white. like see option black white display theme (the PN-300 include white wallpaper choice ... indicating least one genius Pantech). choice larger font size longer list ring tones would useful.Conclusion: find user reviews phone, bit worried would lacking features I've used seen current phones. I'm pleasantly surprised phone. stripped minimalist, make call only, device. local Verizon store PN-300 person asked suggested garbage. salesperson, shaving long, I'm sure is. someone (over 40 crowd?) perfect vision hearing, want phone tiny personal computer, PN-300 easy use full featured cell phone, easily comparable current crop LGs, Motorolas, Samsungs, etc. No, wait ... since PN-300 stuff apparently demanded 30 crowd, infinitely better.

(I saw mixed reviews ordering, figured "they bad.")First all, battery BB battery -- pictured made Japan (it plain silver made China).The battery received hold charge couple hours. sent e-mail complaint; told sometimes given battery snuff; would exchange. second battery lasted little longer even 24 hours. gave up. made bad bet. want bother more. used couple months -- charge twice day. declined steadily finally flat-lined week. Ironically, I'm using old battery seems brilliant compared recent experiences.Maybe get lucky, odds you.

review/text: purchased item WIRELESS UNLIMITED Texas. Although sold new OEM Blackberry battery, allegedly comes one's Blackberry, think is. Why? First all, Blackberry 4 months old, original battery marked "Made Japan." battery first glance label (quite easy fake, course), actually marked "Made China." Another subtle difference OEM battery came Blackberry listed milliamps (if recall, 1400 mA). battery designation amp rating. considering real thing costs $40-$50 cellular retail stores, item one-seventh price, expect? Still, little matter false advertising...they calling genuine OEM. "made China" label, lack retail package (it arrived little plastic pouch, unmarked), importantly, inferior performance, suggest FRAUD. Also -- charged [...] shipping handling even though sent 1st class tiny envelope cost [...] most. would trust seller again.

review/text: case appears identical ones sold Wireless Emporium AccessoryOne. also appears virtually identical widely lauded Smart Phone Experts P6 case, although clear whether original P6 case snap-down interior flap behind two SD cards may stored.First things first. case (and thus, likely similar cases mentioned) definitely real leather. analytical chemist, used reflection IR spectroscopy determine case (including material wrapping clip) actually polyurethane-based imitation leather. said that, case looks nice expecting real leather price range anyway. [Edit: three months daily use case showing significant wear corners (making obvious actually imitation leather).]I several concerns functionality case, far happy it. are:Concern 1: magnetic flap might come open easily snagged something. First, two magnets pretty strong. Second, receiving surface recessed bit, flap stick much. Third (and pleasant surprise), flap springs back closed itself, especially belt--it actually difficult force case remain open position.Concern 2: Treo (I 700wx) might fall easily. case turns fairly snug, short elastic strips sides. I'm yet sure, looks like elastic might also enough give accomodate egrips. definitely like access "naked" Treo. Treo get knocked case still theoretical risk, think much likely simply drop it. fairly easy retrieve 700 case without bumping anything want to, I'd bet true 680 model without protruding antenna.Concern 3: interior snaps might scratch Treo. snaps actually plastic faces quite flat. Whether insert phone screen facing out, yet noticed problem. [Edit: three months use phone facing inward time, indeed scuff left speaker appears come snap. Despite this, still prefer keep phone facing in.]Concern 4: magnets might cause data loss. (Actually, never concern mine, heard others voice it.) problem report. routinely handle electronics items near much stronger magnetic fields lab never problem. (Credit cards another story, however....)Concern 5: magnets might get pressed screen crack it. front case flap actually feel like fairly rigid plastic sheets sewn inside, magnets flat. flap closed thus several plies material phone outside world. case bulletproof, feel like one adequate job protecting Treo, without adding new risks due poor design.Concern 6: clip might come belt. problem--it's stiff. stiff, fact, takes little practice easily slide belt. Also, scratch belts like clamp-style belt clips (although we'll see long imitation leather covering clip holds up....)Concern 7: might like fixed (non-rotating) clip. funny thing generic box mine came sticker saying "Premium Horizontal Fitted Pouch w/ Ratcheting Swivel Palm TREO 650 700w." Nope--but neither expecting one product description page. turns wore prior swivel case horizontal position time anyway, case sits much closer body. harder remove case completely belt (because clip stiff), getting easier practice.Concern 8: Poor access connections. easily access headphone jack whether screen facing out. Either orientation allows access volume buttons (after opening flap) want listen MP3s. (However, way conveniently access 700wx's WMP Play/Pause button, reassign function side button. best reassign "Q" "A" button, accessible phone case, least screen facing out.) However, cannot charge phone, connect synch cable, access ringer on/off switch case.I hope helps. definitely best case needs, inexpensive boot! Four five stars.

review/text: owned one previously, happy it. lasted eighteen months leather around clip finally began tear, making clip's hold case tenuous best. gladly bought replacement.At first glance, new pouch looks same. problem clip tearing away pouch addressed - part case reworked reinforced thicker piece leather - slide case onto belt instead clipping belt.The case seems little larger original - Treo seems slide little front back. interior case still snapped cover concealing storage compartments three memory cards. effect, case functionally original one had.But know, finally figured like it. seems cheaper original one. interior made kind fabric there's puffy feel leather exterior, almost leather sown top cushion. original one seems expensive, luxurious, comparison.In short, case functional, good original version product was. However, ots still better anything else I've found market date.

(Since wireless, hard see quickly headset connected not.) Enabling/disabling bluetooth connection multi-step process, hard hurry (with corded headset, quickly unplug thing). since choice ALWAYS using headset NEVER using headset (since disabling re-enabling bluetooth hassle, remember whether know answer phone), I've chosen NEVER use it.3) buttons headset mean can't see use them. two multi-functional buttons nearly identical size shape. Pushing button briefly something different pushing longer. easy hang person really want mute them. use time, suppose pushing buttons feel become natural remembering long push button want do, beginners occasional users probably make lot mistakes, did.

Using phone disconnect re-establish link much less convenient. stop problem, however, headset remains turned (but disconnected) whole time, adversely affecting battery life. disconnect using phone, turn headset off, voice-dialing thing happen try re-establish link, even try phone turning headset (which work anyway).I must say again, spite above, truly great headset.

review/text: I've using BT250 couple weeks now. Here's I've found:1. belt clip stinks. device drops time. silly see $90 device sabotaged 15 cent piece plastic. (It looks stupid, also.)2. standby time nowhere near 240 hours Jabra advertises. find gives low power indication 24 hours.3. 250 awkward put ear, real pain trying take call.4. I've found way voice dial Blackberry 7290 250.5. distance phone like 10 feet, opposed 30 Jabra advertises.6. volume loud Jabra. turn phone reduce volume using buttons 250 time.I'd recommend Motorola HS810 good carrying case, voice dials 7290 problems, goes easily, intelligently designed buttons.

review/text: Hello,I scientist field Microwave/RF circuits systems. considered several finally chose Jabra A210 along BT250 Jabra headset. review items together.A things note:1) swithcing intuitive BT250, hold power button "n" number seconds, lights flash certain pre-ordained sequence, hold power button required (this sketchy), appliances enter set mode, pairing adapter headset might lost. A210 paired means stylus pressing depressed switch body unit. pairing affected power button. set (headset adapter) 8 hours talk time 240 hours standby time (as per manufacturer's claim), even performs 80% reported claim, wont mess around much power switch. comfortably use day come home night recharge set.2) Quality sent received signals. Please note: jabra A210 pin put 3 settings. Setting # 1 motorola phones, Setting # 3 phones Setting # 2 feel discomfort setting # 1 # 3. LG VX 6100 NON-BLUETOOTH phone verizon. tested settings extensively calling friend. (Thanks Guddu.) tried setting # 1, 2 noticeable problems: (a) friend complained volume voice low, clarity good.(b) could use button head set connect disconnect calls.But must mention, could receive friend's voice absolutely loud clear tones.Both problems alleviated used setting # 3 adapter. fact, started using setting # 3, friend complained voice loud! werent issues related clarity.3) Range: manufacturer claims range 10 meters (30 feet). time, manual, written objects wireless signal path adapter headset, sound quality suffer.Now consider 2 trade offs every RF design. (a) power (b) size. want smallest devices maximum power range. Well physics electronics sharply put us back places. want greater range, need put signal great field strength. needs higher battery consumption, high efficiency non linear amplifiers large antennas. Microstrip patch antennas (generally used low profiles small size) resonate particular frequency length correctly defined. design modifications, length shortened, gain suffers. Also, thanks FCC, strict limitations frequency bands available (the higher frequency, shorter wave length, thus smaller antenna consequently higher gain). FCC makes many RF devices work lower frequencies RF engineers would like operate at. Also, due fear signal one device interferring devices, FCC puts limits amount power device put out.Given considerations, A210 BT250 required excellent power efficiency (8 hours talk time 240 hours stand time) also small compact size (very small batteries small antennas) provide range quite satisfactory. walked radius 10 feet even walls, metal partitions, etc, signal strength affected. ever 10 feet, signal much noise it, move closer adapter.To honest you, happy range. dont think range $130 worth (for adapter headset = $50 + $80). Period. 10 feet range cost like $50 (for both).So basically, reviewed basic factors. However, one major design flaw would like bring attention. is: head set adapter enter stand mode one minute non-usage. even middle call parties keep silent minute, head set adapter stop communicating. call disconnected. either pull adapter jack cell phone put back in, press volume key cell phone (basically thing cell phone) able resume conversation bluetooth devices. ever voice operable. Meaning, adapter headset enter stand mode conversation parties call silent, even start talking, adapter head set start communicating.This extremely uncomfortable. blue tooth head set adapter kit paid $130 more, want absolute mobility reason come back adpater unless free will.Lastly, recommendation people designed set. need incorporate greater features adapter head set. able handle voice data also music types audio information. means might need use efficient method modulation. Maybe using FSK constant envelope modulation (I deal military radar communication, dont know modulation used blue tooth), cannot include much information FSK signal. Try using QAM, maybe high order QAM, thing capable handling audio information. need change design is: new power amplifier high efficiency linear. Probably class E Class F feed forward Envelope elimination restoration (Kahn) Doherty principles. simple. need one time engineering development cost, long term - market domination mass production, make it.As buyers. rich, techno geek business person constantly phone - Go this. good.But limited resources (money) buy simple wired hands free kit. fact times battery move get back within range, long reliability wired handsfree kit.Update: June 25th, 2005: way, lost one A210 recently purchased one more. tried one test recently. got adapter radio shack (Part # 274-397) accepts 3/32" submini stereo plug ( plug A210) fits 1/8" mini stereo jack (as plug standard head phone jacks). Thus connected A210 adapter connected new Creative MuVo MP3 player. put BT250. worked!! could hear music blue tooth set up!BUT music quality poor... blue tooth unit probably enough sampling rate speech, able handle sudden faster changes amplitude, phase frequency music signal.Nevertheless works.Kaushik.

I've using 18months generally problems. think bluetooth handsfree kits general worth money wired ones give true hands free works (doesn't fall ear turn head driving). Jabra particular far better design others market moment design likely fit different ear head shapes. Also in-ear design means best chance hearing party clearly. never able hear person. Setup easy takes 2min. Day day operation simple, turn works.There 2 reasons give 4 star rating.1) time connect T68i range (but fair think crappy T68i Jabra)2) outdoors good cutting background noise person end can't hear verywell (NOTE: i'm outdoors.
