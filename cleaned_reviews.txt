reviewtext use aliph jawbone surprise they're perfect matches other. eargels fit speaker nub jawbone exactly secure find eargels fall occasionally. also expecting act like earplugs snugly fit ear canal case. however eagels fit quite comfortably. would imagine they're pretty good headset designed. they're nice soft molded fit ears would think they fit mine pretty well. they're little pieces plastic i'm sure else say them. current headset uncomfortable i'd say go ahead buy set these. they're expensive might find good solution!
