product/title: Mobile Action MA730 Handset Manager - Bluetooth Data Suite
review/text: First of all, the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped. A week and a half later I received another email telling me that they are sorry, but they don't actually have any of these items, and if I received an email telling me it has shipped, it was a mistake.When I finally got my money back, I went through another company to buy the product and it won't work with my phone, even though it depicts that it will. I have sent numerous emails to the company - I can't actually find a phone number on their website - and I still have not gotten any kind of response. What kind of customer service is that? No one will help me with this problem. My advice - don't waste your money!

review/text: The price was right for this cable ($11.95+$4.94 S&H;) compared with Sony Ericssons offering ($25+). There are a few different prices on Amazon through the same company, MyNetDeals.com, so make sure you get the $11.95 one.So I popped the CD in, followed the 2 line .txt instruction file on the disk and...nothing happened?!? Well, my phone started to charge. If you have a similar problem you may try what I did.I had previously installed a variety of the S.E. downloadable software on my computer. It took me about 15 minutes of fumbling around, but I made my way to the Phone Monitor Options by opening the catcheventatl.exe in C:\Program Files\Sony Ericsson\Mobile\Mobile Phone Monitor. From the pop-up window you have to hit the Options button. There may be a better way to get here, but this is how I did it. Go to the COM Ports tab and enable all of the COM ports. It told me it wouldnt enable COM4 because of an IR conflict, but within a few seconds, my phone was recognized, presumably on one of the remaining ports. I may not have had this issue if I installed the software fresh with the cable, but I had previously been using the IR feature to transfer data. The cable is faster than IR, but not tremendously. The big benefit is you dont have to worry about losing line of site and messing up your download.Hope you have success.

review/text: Well, it technically does what it is supposed to do--that is, allows you to transfer files from your phone to your computer or vice versa. But, it is rude & puts up a fight to do so. The thing came with no instructions, so it took forever to install. Once installed, it creates a desktop icon which can't be removed or modified...because it's not actually a desktop icon (when I figure out what exactly this thing is, I'll post it) or in the registry at all. Actual transfer of files takes over the entire computer (don't have anything else running) and is slower than a floppy drive! I've found a ton of settings and such that the software changed without asking (rude in my book), so I'm probably going to have to re-install Windows to get everything back the way I like it. Although, it's nice to have the pics off my phone to email and have a custom wallpaper & ringtones on my phone, I'm really thinking of returning this rude little punk. If I could, I'd give it zero stars.(I'm not 100% sure that this will make a difference since the main problem appears to be Sony's software that you download from them, but the cable appears to be made by someone other than Sony and the oficial Sony Data cable is pretty much only sold through Sony's website.)Update on 6/4/2006:I was given a data cable for my Sony Ericsson z500a as a gift (turned out to be a 3rd party cable like this product is). At first, I was happy that I'd be able to transfer pictures taken with my camera phone to my computer to email to friends back home...but after installing everything, the thing only worked a few times at a nerve-rackingly slow pace. After tons of headaches messing with that, I contacted Sony's tech support. They don't seem to know how to figure out problems very well, and about all they could do on that call was get my info to send out a new cable. The new cable (Sony Ericsson cable) doesn't seem to work either, and I've called them several times now--each time speaking with 2-3 reps.So, my advice would be to not bother with the data cable (third party or Sony's) since neither will work properly. If you have a third party cable such as this product, don't tell Sony tech support because then they won't help you, so you're basically just out the money you spent on a cheap unofficial cable. Just enjoy your Sony Ericsson z500a & watch anyone who has a camera phone that has a working data cable for ideas for your next phone.

review/text: If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for.

review/text: I've gone through many different bluetooth headphones. This is the first pair I ever bought many many years ago. I'm wearing them right now. I've tried the S9's, S10's, Jabra Halo, Jabra Sport, Arctic Cooling. That doesn't even include the plain old jerk-buds.These look atrocious. My wife hates them. They are still my gold standard.I have a walk that kills BT reception every time on every headset. These only lose the signal for half a step. The Jabra Sport, by contrast, doesn't even work when it is set on the table in front of me. The Arctic Cooling headphones are my latest. They are more comfortable, but still lose the signal whenever I walk outside.Yes, I live next to a Cell Tower. So my situation is very stressful for a BT headphone or headset. The BT820s, old school, just work. Period.

I could not get any sound to come out when connected with my Sony Ericsson w600i in phone or Walkman mode, and people could not hear me when I called them. I tried every setting possible, read the instructional booklets for each device and the thing still wouldn't to anything when connected. I am guessing that this headset works fantastically with any Motorola device, but as far as I'm concerned this product is guilty of false advertising.

review/text: The Motorola StarTAC Hands Free Car kit is outstanding. The speaker audio is loud and clear and the microphone pick up crisp. I have had hands free on my previous car phones and it is the &quot;way to go&quot;. The kit is very inclusive and easy to install if you are comfortable with basic electronics and able to take the molding, etc, off your car in order to run the antenna coax, etc. (External antenna is not included but you really need to get one for maximum performance) Anyone who has installed a Ham or CB radio will be right at home. The mounting of the holder for the StarTAC cell phone itself may need some modification or you may want to make a bracket in order to get a neat installation.I would suggest that you mount it as high as possible in order to keep it as close to your driving line of sight for safety concerns. Mine worked flawlessly after a 2-3 hour install in a Ford F-150. Will be mounting one in our Lincoln TC soon. Also suggest that you mount the hands free microphone near the center of the car (near the rear view mirror or center it on the dash) so that a passenger can be heard should they speak. A must have.

review/text: If you have had an issue with the Jawbone headset staying in your ear, purchase these babies and pick out the one that works best in your ear. Then you can attach it to your Jawbone one of two ways. First is the easiest, take off the twist ear piece and place the Jabra EarGel on. Put it on your ear and find the best position for you. Then place a couple of small (super tiny) drops of super glue on the EarGel and the Jawbone. Let it setup overnight and presto! You have a great bluetooth that stays in place. The other is to take one of the extra ear buds and take it apart and keep the ring. Place that ring inside the EarGel and glue it into place. Keep in mind you must have the correct position so when you put it on that it has the perfect fit once it is twisted.

I bought the Jabra Clear Gels from 'Radio Snack' for under $5 and replaced the factory bud with this empty plastic ring on the jawbone, then pressed the gel piece over the ring and speaker hole to make a nice factory-like fit to the jawbone and a custom fit to my large ear canal. There was no extreme stretching of the Gel over the thin ring. The new Gel with the factory locking ring holds itself securely in my ear and the sound quality is much improved over the loose fitting factory buds.

It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece.

Does it go up, down, sideways, or at a slant to follow the "dip" my ear has just in front of the hole. And since I can't figure that out, & the fact even the small one is too big, it keeps slipping out of my ear. Thank goodness for the loop, or I'd have lost it long ago. Also, it becomes very irritating to the ridges in my ear & I usually have to take it off. I wish they still had the gels that came with the bluetooth. That one was really comfortable.

They also caused my Jawbone Prime to protrude far enough so that the front part no longer touched my face (which is required for their noise reduction circuitry to work). I threw these away and am now using the stock earbud with the ear hook.These are designed for people with a certain ear shape. If your ears don't conform to this shape (which is likely the case for many people), these will be useless.

review/text: I purchased this product after searching for ways to make Jawbone fit better. It worked!! Now my Jawbone fits perfectly, not popping/falling out of my ear. Also noticed I didn't need the volume as loud with audio directed into the ear canal. The Jawbone rests perfectly against my jaw for crystal clear conversations. It's also not necessary to keep the earpiece in the ear at all times while in standby. The eargels make the headset easy to find in your pocket/purse and put in the ear when receiving a call. I do recommend washing the earbuds with antibacterial soap and water prior to use then occasionally to reduce ear tenderness. Make sure to dry it well before putting it back on your bluetooth headset or other device.

review/text: These EarGels make using my Jawbone I for long periods of time much more comfortable. I just put the EarGel over the existing ear button and it fits just right in my ear. No need to push and shove to get it seated and tight. Makes for a better drive when I am not always pushing in on the Jawbone to make sure it stays put. Great addition to any bluetooth earpiece that it will fit.

review/text: Ladies and Gentlemen..... I bought this product to go with my jawbone 2. and it is GREAT!! With this product I am able to take off the loop that comes with my jawbone and wear it all day without any problems. I actually have to turn the sound down when I wear it because it is loud. It looks so much better without the ear loop. I found the best way to figure out which size to use is to try the ear gels in your ear first until you find the right one. Be careful putting the ear gel over the Jawbone ear piece ( you dont want to tear it). There is a chance that these ear gels wont fit your ear but for the price they cost it is worth the gamble. If it fits you'll find a new level of comfort, sound quality and not to mention it looks a lot better to get rid of the ear loop.

review/text: These EarGels are the best solution bar-none to fix the comfort issue with the Aliph Jawbone 2. They make it possible to leave the jawbone in place for extreme durations. My only concern now is that my jawbone is so comfy and fixed it so well with no weight that I might fall asleep on it or take a sower with it on! To mod this onto the jawbone I simply removed the earbud O-ring and found the right size eargel for my ear. (Large in this case) then got some super glue to paint around where the O-ring attached on the jawbone, then simply placed the jawbone inside the eargel that I fitted on my ear. Left it in my ear for a few hours to dry and done. (Course I kept wearing it even after those hours were up) :)

review/text: These eargels work with the Aliph The New Jawbone, or Jawbone 2, or the slim jawbone. I found that the earbuds provided from Aliph did not suit my ear. It was not secure even with the earloop attached. These did the trick. It was a gamble at first since i found barely any reviews on such a product with its compatibility with the New Jawbone, but it worked out for the best. These are not made for the jawbone so you are relying on its snug fit to stay in place. I removed the original eargel and replaced these onto the unit. It is snug enough for me to use without the earloop. Also its design makes the eargel stay in place in your ear. It may be tricky to fit in your ear at first but in time you'll get the feel for it. It fits my ear perfectly with the largest size. As a bonus you get multiple sizes. This is an excellent solution for those that don't have the right ear for the original gels provided for the New Jawbone.On another note it attracts dust because it has the silicon feel. Washing with water fixes it right up.This review is based upon purchase through Amazon and ownership for more than half a year.

Of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound, but they're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping.The only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use.

review/text: Kudos to the dude/dude-ette who figured out that the Jabra ear gels might improve the bad, painful and ineffective stock rubber covers provided with your Jawbone product. The Jabra gels aren't a perfect solution for my Icon-Hero, but they're heaps better than the original earbud-nonsense supplied with the bluetooth unit (which I totally dig). Still, the drama of finding a way to "rig" a $100 electronic device from a reputable manufacturer so that it doesn't hurt your ear is not cool. Aliph-Jawbone are you listening? I know that all ears and fit requirements are different, but I'm just sayin'...really? Anyway, if you've been looking for an alternative to the problem(s) associated with the original, messed-up-a$$ earbuds, you might already know that you gotta use one of the round earbuds like the one on the unit when it was new so that the Jabra eargel can fit over it. Here's the thing: depending on which size Jabra eargel you use, you may have to swap out that stock Jawbone ear bud. I.E. - the large Jabra gel doesn't fit over the smallest, Jawbone ear bud. So be prepared to play with those combinations a bit as well as figuring out the right Jabra gel to get your best fit. Once you work that out, give it a chance as you and your ear may need a moment to adjust to how it feels. The volume improvement is nice too. Good luck.

review/text: If you have trouble getting your Jawbone to fit like I did, these may be a good solution for you. The largest one worked great for me. I wear it without the ear loop now. However, you can do a number of different combination with/without earloop and with/without the original ear buds attached to achieve your perfect fit. The other nice thing is that these sit in your ear and blocks out more outside noise so you can actually hear better. I found myself turning the volume down a bit after using these.

Unfortunately, contradictory to what the other reviewer indicated, the ear gels did not even come close to fitting over the ear piece on the Jawbone, and thus were pretty much useless to me. In fact, one of the gels even split open as I was trying to make it fit over the earpiece on the Jawbone. Maybe it's because I have smaller ear, and I had to use the smallest one, but it totally didn't work for me. Oh well, at least they weren't too expensive.

review/text: I've used these ear gels on several products and have been very pleased with their comfort. I currently use them to on my Aliph Jawbone. They work well and there's no problem with hearing callers; however, if you think the Jawbone is difficult to get on with one hand you definitely don't want to add the ear gels and continue using the ear loop. Using the loop and gels in combination is a 2-handed endeavor and even then can be frustrating when you're in a hurry. I continue to use the loop because when I used the gel alone, I felt like the earpiece would not stay in securely in my ear. With the loop and the gel, the earpiece is snug and secure, even in the harshest (I drive a Jeep and take the top off) winds; and is comfortable to wear.

The eargels fit over the speaker nub on the Jawbone it's not exactly secure and I find the eargels fall off occasionally. I was also expecting these to act more like earplugs, that snugly fit in your ear canal but that isn't the case. However, the eagels do fit quite comfortably. I would imagine they're pretty good on the headset for which they were designed. They're nice and soft and molded to fit most ears, I would think (they fit mine pretty well). They're just little pieces of plastic so I'm not sure what else to say about them. If you're current headset is uncomfortable, I'd say go ahead and buy a set of these. They're not very expensive and you might find a good solution!

review/text: I use these with my Jawbone 2.First the good: once you get the earpiece in place with one of these on it, it stays in well and is much more comfortable than the basic ones that come with the jawbone. However, there are several things that don't make these eargels great. First, they don't stay on the earpiece very well. It is very easy to knock off the eargel, especially while putting it in your ear which can be very frustrating. Each one of the 3 sizes fit differently too which I found very odd. Luckily the one I use fits better than the others. Second, positioning it in place in your ear takes some effort each and every time you put it on. This magnifies the first issue. And last, because these are a bit bigger than the basic rubber that comes with the jawbone it makes the jawbone stick out a little further making it a little bit more likely for the jawbone to separate from your cheek while talking. You'll find this out when the person on the other end says "what?" a few times.All in all these are still better than the standard rubber pieces that come with the jawbone. And for the price I think it is worth it. I recommend finding a way to get the eargel to stay on better and then half the frustration will go away. I think some other reviewers have ideas for how to do this.

review/text: Super fast delivery. The last ear loop on my Jawbone had worn out. The large ear gel fit over the Jawbone earbud and, with a little superglue, stays there. It fits in my ear without using any loops. After a full day, the ear is a little tender, but it is getting better the more I use it. I would highly recommend the ear gels for anyone with a Jawbone. Improves sound and the fit of the sensor with the jaw.

review/text: Product arrived much quicker than expected. I have a Jawbone 2 bluetooth earpiece, and I keep breaking the ear-loop, and I could not find replacement parts. Not wanting to give up my Jawbone (and rather not buy a new one) I thought I would first give the Jabra EarGels a try... and I'm glad I did! My earpiece not only stays in place without the ear-loop, it just functions better. I CANNOT shake it off my head. It actually isolates the sound better into my ear. With 6 provided (3 left and 3 right) finding the perfect fit was easy (you will need to use the original ear cushion in addition to the EarGel for two of the EarGels to fit best with the earpiece) - all and all... a five-star product, and company!

review/text: Bought these for my Aleph Jawbone IPROS: Fit right on, stays snug. Do not have to use the ear loop any more. Cheap. Isolates sound from background noise better than stock Jawbone earpieces.CONS: Ocassionally comes the headset when not in use or when I take it off my ear. Could not find one that fit my ear perfectly.BOTTOM LINE: A no-brainer upgrade for Jawbone users. Not a perfect solution but much better than what came with the Jawbone and its too cheap to not give it a try.

review/text: I have a motorola H695 bluetooth which I managed to adapt to use with the eargels, what a difference! I can hear better, I threw out the ear loop which I no longer need at all. The earpiece stays in very well. I use a large one with the bluetooth and I used the medium ones for my earphones which cuts out more of the background noise so I need less volume. The come with a set of three sizes sm med lg for both ears so you get 6 all together.

review/text: I have been using in-ear bluetooth devices for a couple of years. My wife and daughter (of the small ear canal clan) had opted for over the ear designs because of fit and comfort issue. As it turned out, neither of them used their ear buds because of the loose/insecure fit and feel of the ear hanger design. The Jabra gels resolved that problem by 'sizing down' to match their diminutive ears . . . . It would be nice if you could order by specific size (s-m-l)and side (l-r) rather than getting the 'variety pack'.

review/text: They look cheep and feel cheep and well.. they are cheep but they don't work which is the bottom line. Fitting them onto the jawbone does not lock into place so the ear piece you just spent over a 100bucks for falls out of your ear! It's not worth it since Jawbone gives you five ear buds that lock onto the Jawbone, which fit your snugly in your ear. They also give you a left ear or a right ear bar that lets you choose which works for you. So this product fails and had I'd seen them in person I wouldn't have spent my money on them.

review/text: I bought these Jabra Eargels from another retailer, because I thought they had the colored ones, which are supposedly more durable than their clear counterparts. Well, they did not have the colored ones, but the clear ones I received from them were horrible junk. I tried the pieces on before fitting them with headphones and the medium and large pieces fit great in my ear, I thought I was really going to like this product! I didn't consider to think that putting in the somewhat oversized earbud driver was going to stretch the entire piece. It took a lot of struggle to even get the earbud in in the first place, I had to let them warm up so that the material was at least somewhat stretchy first. I eventually got the earbuds to stay, and tried to fit them in my ear. Well, they wouldn't. They were stretched to far to fit in my ear AT ALL, it was like trying to force a square peg into a round hole.So I let them sit for a while and went to do something else, I come back and decide they're not for me(after trying all sizes), and when I'm packing them back up, I notice that the large size has a giant split right down the middle on both sides, leaving a tiny 3mm strip of material that hasn't torn through. I returned them, and who would blame me? See the title, this product is complete garbage.

review/text: I'm giving these a 3 star rating because despite the three different sizes, I never felt as if they gave a good fit. They are soft, but still contributed to some fatigue after wearing for more than an hour. Additionally, I bought these ear gels to replace the factory ear bud on the Jawbone 2. I never got a good fit and seal, and the JB2 felt unstable while wearing the ear gels. Also, they distorted the angle for the JB2, which needs to have a contact point along to jawbone to work properly. I eventually went back to the factory ear bud, which is less comfortable, but more functional.

review/text: I purchased these EarGels for my Jawbone (JB) BlueTooth (BT) headset as most people I have spoken with swear by them. The ear loop provided by JB breaks when I put the BT device in my pocket and the plastic ear piece gets very uncomfortable after wearing it a short period of time.I took the plastic ear piece off of the JB only to discover that the hole in the EarGels are too big. Therefore the JB comes off quite easily.I put the most round plastic ear piece that comes with the JB back on the JB (there are different shapes- some round, some pointed to fit your ear better) as the pointy ear piece will obviously not fit well on the EarGel. This worked ok but now the EarGel would fall out of my ear with the JB attached. This same thing happened no matter what size EarGel I used. Not good either.After monkeying around with this for some time (and splitting one of the EarGels down the side), I have come to this conclusion. Most people will probably have to wear the ear loop with the EarGels as the EarGels are not really meant to be worn alone and/or cannot hold the JB headset on its own. The EarGels definitely feel much better than the hard plastic ear pieces that JB gives you. For the price of the JB, they ought to partner with Jabra and incorporate the EarGels with the JB headset.Bottom line, the EarGels are much better than what you get from the BT makers but are not the end solution for most people.

review/text: If you take the ear bud off the Jawbone and try to attach the Jabra Eargels, they won't stay on very well. Instead, notice that the Jawbone comes with two round earbuds that appear to be identical. Tear the rubber shroud off one of them to expose the round plastic piece inside of it. Take this plastic piece and lock it onto the Jawbone (read user's manual). The Eargels will slip over this piece and hold quite firmly to the headset. Notice also that the Eargels have a square notch on the inside. Point the notch toward the back of the Jawbone. This will align the piece properly with the ear.The Eargels allow the Jawbone to be securely held in the ear without the annoyingly difficult earloop, but cause a little discomfort in my ear because I have to use the larger pieces. With the earloop, I can use the smallest piece and the Eargels are very comfortable.

review/text: I recently purchased a Jawbone bluetooth headset. Works great. Ear fit was a little loose and I found myself pushing it more into my ear to hear better. Having seen the suggestions and other reviews to use the Jabra Clear Ear Gels, I decided to try some. Got them yesterday and couldn't get them to fit. Read some more reviews this morning and saw that you have to play with them a bit. So I did. I found out that the set I got had a few different sizes BUT all of them except 1 were formed for use in the right hand ear! I have poor hearing in my right ear so usually use my left for phone conversations. I was able to use the one for the left ear and get it to fit pretty well. I don't know if it is the best fit cause I couldn't compare any other size. I did remove the 1/4-turn ear piece that came with the Jawbone and stuck the Jabra directly onto the stem. After removing the ear loop, it seems that the modified Jawbone will stay in my ear and I can remove it a certain way so that it doesn't slip off. If I use the earloop, the Jabra ear gel slips off when taking it off my ear. Is comfortable but I haven't used it for a long time yet.

Sometimes they do fall off so you have to be very careful with them.Unfortunately these eargels reviewed here are not them. You want these: EarGels (MiniGels) for Jabra BT250, BT250v, BT500, BT2020, C220s, C250, GN6210 are not them. They are only available from Jabra [...]

review/text: I recently purchased a Aliph Jawbone BT headset. #1 BT Headset on the market IMHO. I wasn't wild about the piece that goes around your ear however. I never have been. So I picked up a pack of the Jabra EarGels. Best decision of my life. I pulled the plastic ring that snaps onto the Jawbone out of one of the earpieces that comes with it and stuck it inside the EarGel. Snapped it onto the Jawbone, and bingo. Instant comfort. Can't go wrong. Great product!

review/text: Bought these based on a recommendation from another site for a badly shaped earplug for a headphone I bought. The three sets (sizes) are really nice in that it allows some variety. The shape of these really funnel the sound into your ear, which is nice and helps with outside sound. The fit in the ear means that it will hold most headsets in your ear comfortably without a hook or other method from the headset.The nodule on the bottom fits over most earpiece sized rods - I've easily put it over one as big as a in-ear headphone jack and as small as the rod on my LG headset from work (which was far too small for every other one I found).

review/text: All I have read about these was pretty much true. You can remove the rubber piece and press these over the part that it was attached to and they will stay, but they do come out with a little tug. A fine line of rubber cement will fix that though, and it peels off if necessary. But the great thing is that they will hold the Jabra in your ear without the ear loop. And that's huge, especially for someone like me with really weird shaped ears that nothing else [except an over the head headset] seemed to work. All in all worth the cost easily. I just wish you could order multiple pieces in one size only. If I lose the 1 that fist my ear I have to buy a 6 pack again just to get the one that I need.

When it's in my ear, I can jump up and down (not that there's a usual reason to) and it doesn't come off. I'm using the largest size for the right side. Just don't keep it in the car when it's hot outside, the rubber might get a little soft and come off the Jawbone. let it cool and it's back to normal.

No mater which size earloop I tried, the Jawbone would flap against the side of my face as I walked. As a result, the 'noise assassin' sensor wouldn't touch my face, mitigating the benefit it should have had.Pros:+Jawbone now fits securely in my ear, even without the ear loop+Incredibly comfortable+Sound seems 'clearer' now that the speaker fits snugger in my ear and the noise assassin sensor touches my face.Cons:+The silicon isn't perfectly clear, and the yellowish tinge makes them look dirty+Much larger than I thought they would be - they're quite conspicuous.

Oh and once you get them (they come in a package of three for three different ear sizes, small, medium and large) you can super glue it on to your jawbone for a little more stability because for the jawbone the eargel can be a little loose. oh and its much louder then the stock ear adapter deal that comes with the jawbone. for me it was too loud with my krazer cell phone. I had the volume setting for as low as it would go and it was still blasting my ear drum. I ended up wodding up a piece of paper and sticking in there to baffle the volume. works near perfect now..

review/text: This device works great! The speaker is hidden under the dash and it still sounds perfect. The microphone does not have any feedback and picks up anyone's voice anywhere in the car. The external antanne (supported but not included) is great as the typical cell phone reception in my area is weak. I also like the small personal handset for private conversations. I did my own installation but would recommend hiring it done unless you have done something like this before (tapping into the fuse box, mounting hardware in a car, pulling wires under the dash). A reasonable installation charge would be between $50 and $100(it's not easy). I had to purchase an additional "post" to mount the cradle to as I could not find a suitable place to use the mount provided with the kit. This is a great unit and looks very professional when installed. Only problem is after using mine, everyone else in my family wants one!

product/title: Nokia Complete Hands-Free Car Kit with Audio Handset for Nokia Phones
review/text: This is one product that you'll wonder how you survived without it. It is very well integrated with the phone. Has antenna jack in cradle for external antenna (really needed in my area), automatic charger when you put the phone in the cradle, volume control on phone when talking is adjustable with the up and down buttons on phone, can control your car stereo to turn it off when phone in use, handset for private conversations.Note: 1) unless you are very technical, I would get a professional install -- f you want the phone to control the stereo, you'll probably pay extra because of extra contact relay required by most car stereo receivers. 3) For my cars (Chevy Tahoe and Chevy Silvarado Pickup) I had to buy an extra bracket to attach the cradle to the dash without drilling holes in the dash -- it attaches behind one of the seams in the dash. That costs ~20 more but is worth it so you don't have screw holes in the dash. 4) To control the car sterio, most receivers will need a contact relay (12V 30A, SPDT) to shut the receiver off and on. I wish that Nokia would just supply that part ... because it was hard to find (Radio Shack doesn't sell that particular part).I would definitely recommend this hands-free unit. The only thing bad about it was that the Nokia 5165 phone was basically free for me but the hands-free unit cost alot more ...

I often hold conference calls in my car on the way into the office. When travelling with the family, we often call the grandparents because it is the one place where everyone can join in the call at once. And the car kit is almost invisible with all but the cradle hidden behind the dashboard panels. The cradle is strong and sturdy, and, with the phone attached, does not look out of place next to the steering wheel. Combined with Nokia's quick dial features, the car kit makes using a phone in the car relatively safe.

review/text: This product was delivered by provider on time and the quality is better the original I bought directly from my cell phone provider and way cheaper! The only down side is that the cord is short so it is difficult to talk on the phone while it's charging (unless you are hands free).

review/text: I bought 2 of these and a RAZR battery from EFORCE CITY throught AMAZON assuming that Amazon would enforce some truth in advertising. Clearly all 3 products are china knockoffs according to the counterfit guide that one finds on other motorola product pages, but conveniently left off this one. I wrote eforce to compalin (dont bother calling!) and they insisted that all of their products came straight from Motorola!The chargers work fine, so for the price, I got what I paid for. The battery however (also clearly a knockoff) held less of a charge than the one it was replacing. I asked for a replacement(OEM as advertised this time Please!) and another knockoff was sent. Im disappointed in AMAZON for this. I was told to return anything I was unhappy with. Ill lose out on shipping both ways.one star because it worked, and they lied.Motorola Counterfeit Identification Guidebook: Motorola, Inc.

review/text: The car charger I ordered and got works great with my phone, but when I got it, it didn't look like the one the seller had pictured. He said it was on OEM. The one I received just had a small blue dot that lit up. The charger does look like it would be an OEM. I read from one seller that the one with the small blue dot was the newer model but I just checked the Motorola site and the one with the all blue glowing top is still the one they show. Reading a review by another buyer on another sellers site I found he had the same problem I did. So you may get the charger that is actually pictured and you may not depending on the seller. (Charger works great the reason for the 4stars and not 5stars is the charger did not look like the one pictured. If you really want what is pictured you may want to ask the seller if it is the one pictured, if you don't care what it looks like and just want one that works good then you can just order it)

review/text: It's cheap, eforcity delivers quickly, however, may not actually be OEM. All of the OEM chargers I've seen (model number SYN0847) has glowing stylized "M" motorola logo. This item, however, does not; it only has a small blue led underneath the "M" that glows when it's plugged in. All of the other labeling on the charger looks authentic Motorola. Maybe a really good knockoff? Anyway, does the job just fine (see title), and, again, it beats paying $20 at cingular.

review/text: This is NOT a real Motorola product, the M logo which is supposed to be illuminated from behind is not, there is a little blue LED below the logo - not even close to the real thing. Naturally I am leary of using this to charge my new MOTORIZR Z6tv (Verizon) as I don't want to toast my battery - I tried it on my old Razor phone as a guiny pig and it seemed to work (no smoke came out of it) but i won't use it on my new phone unless I have some kind of emergency and have to.

review/text: Interesting shape and blue light that glows when this unit is plugged into the cigarette lighter. Can't believe that I've paid 5x as much for off brand car chargers in the past. Some have come apart, some have stopped working after shorting out. This Motorola charger feels like a quality piece and appears to be one that will last. Have no idea why anyone would buy an off brand when you can have legendary Motorola quality with a cool looking shape/light. Can't think of one thing that would improve this charger. The price is the best part!! Highly recommend!

review/text: I bought this to recharge my phone, garmin, etc. It looks like the authentic Motorola recharger, but it won't recharge anything. Sure, it keeps the device working, almost, your device will run out of power eventually on this recharger, but slowly. However, I figured it would recharge the Garmin, etc, during use like my other rechargers did. I thought perhaps the LED light was using up too much power. I dismantled the thing after a great deal of effort and injury, and knocked out the light. It will now charge my Garmin very well. I don't recommend this product.

review/text: I bought this charger for only a couple of bucks and it works like a charm. I don't expect it last forever so i purchased a couple of back-ups just in case. Each one of these Adapters failed after a couple months use, even light use. I would skip this one and seek another way to charge such as an using an inverter and home plug in charger. This year I switched to an iPhone.

review/text: I have been looking for this adapter for some time now and found it at Amazon.com. The price is great, arrived before schedule, in new condition but did not work in my car. Everything fit properly but it would not charge my phone - I did not notice an illuminated LED which would indicate power input. In all fairness, my cigarette lighter may be on the brink and therefore not transferring current/voltage; I doubt it though. I had already thrown away the packaging so I couldn't return it so now I'm stuck with it.Maybe once I insert it into another vehicle, it may work. For now, this is it.

review/text: Love phone. Sleak design and not over burden with bells and whistles. However, Amazon and Cingular (AT&T) need to better coordinate the option of extending your Cingular contract with purchase of new phone from Amazon. Cingular over charged me $59.99 a month for an additional new plan....instead of extending my "family plan" contract for 24 months. Cingular customer service was terrible, Amazon on the otherhand was great. It took a day or two but they gave me a special Cingular number and my problem was solved. A great deal on a new phone but watch your phone bill closely.

The cover fits like a glove and keeps my phone from sliding around and helps absorb the daily bumps my phone gets.The cover is well worth the money.The only problem is that the hole for the SD card door is not larger enough to allow you to open the door and take out the SD card without taking the cover off or you have to take a razor blade and enlarge the cell phone cover opening.

You either have to remember where they are, or use a fine blade to cut out the holes. Matte black. Will offer some protection against scratches. It does fit the qwerty keyboard nicely, no obstruction of any of these keys. Also no obstruction of the camera lens. Can't open the card slot-cut out too small.

product/title: Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset (Pumpkin Orange) [Motorola Retail Packaging]
review/text: Bluetooth cell phone headsets are really a subjective choice. Some love them and others hate them, and some models seem to fit one person's ear (and lifestyle) better than another.That being said, this reviewer will try to offer an (overdue) opinion on what has turned out to be a pretty good choice in a well-made Bluetooth cell phone headset.When I first looked at the Motorola H500, it's price tag was in the $100 range, so it was easy to pass on in favor of wired headsets. But with the recent price drops, this unit is not only worth considering, it's now even lower priced than some of the better wired units that were former favorites. Considering that so many states and localities have laws against cell phone use while driving, this can be an excellent communication tool if used carefully and safely.There are many brands and model out there to choose from, but the Motorola H500 is well worth consideration, especially in light of its excellent pricing. Once adjusted and positioned correctly to the ear, its overall sound quality has turned out to be excellent. Had held off on making a decision between brands and models mostly because I wear glasses, but after a bit of retail store test driving for fit and sound, found (like other reviewers) that this headset seems to settle easily to my ear and just seems to fit properly.One way of looking at how well a Bluetooth cell phone headset functions would perhaps be to rate its use during everyday tasks or activities, so here are a few of those, along with my personal findings.- Driving: excellent, quite functional, 5-stars.- Walking: excellent, 5-stars.- Cycling: excellent, low wind noise, 5-stars.- Running: OK, 4-stars (felt like it might fall off).- Computing: excellent, 5-stars.- Sleeping: decent, 4-stars... hey, just joking here!Don't want to go on a rant about driving while using a cell phone, but if you take the time to read your phone's manual along with the one for the Motorola H500, you'll find that you can use it with voice activated functions, so that you don't need to fool with cell phone dialing when driving. Just program your phone, say your party's name into the Bluetooth device and you'll be automatically connected.Color selections - something for everyone:-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Silver-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Black-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Pink-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Orange-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Teal BluePros:- Overall good sound quality, very little static.- Comfortable to wear/use, has an ergonomic ear hook.- Clean, streamlined design.- Good range, better than some others.- Bluetooth 1.2 means less interference & faster connections.- Inexpensive, reasonably priced.- About 8 hours talk time and 200 hours standby time on a charge.Cons:- Ringtone alerts, but that's a personal thing.- Small volume controls.Is this Motorola headset the newest, latest and greatest? Nope. If you want that, check out the newJawbone II Bluetooth Headsetby Aliph, but then check out the price on that unit and compare the features.Summary:The Motorola H500 is an inexpensive Bluetooth cell phone headsets, offering good sound quality, nice ergonomics, and better-than-average range. It's an excellent communication device, adding to driving safety if used carefully. If you're looking for a good Bluetooth headset at a reasonable price, it's well worth considering.Update:For those who privately asked, my H500 didn't come in a box. It came in a ziplock-style bag that was marked "bulk" on the label. It contained the H500 headset, AC charger, user guides and a "Motomanual." From all appearances it was brand new.

review/text: I got this earpiece after my $100 one broke with minimal usage. I only use it to call my friends long distance once a week or so. It does it's job well and the sound is good. My friends never really complain about the noise or sound while I am using it. I will say that it is annoying since you don't know if it is "on" or "off". When you try to call sometimes it will automatically dial the last number your cell phone has and it might not be the person you want to call. It also has a tendency to easily be turned on and I have more then one occassion called my brother a few times with it in my purse. That is just with it accidently having the button on the earpiece pushed and as I said before, it will automatically dial the last number it has on the cellphone. It does not "sit" inside the ear, but hangs from your ear. I have not had too much problems with that, but if you like to have the thing in the ear then this isn't the one for you. The color is nice and the price was really good considering how much they use to go for. If anything happens to this one, it won't hurt my wallet like my $100 one did.

review/text: This is a fabulous device. It is wonderful when it works properly, and it is frustrating when it does not. I have used this product for almost a year now. It comes with 2 of the rubber pieces. I have now lost both of the pieces. a 2 foot drop to the wood floor caused an inner piece of the speaker to fall off.The device comes with a neckband so you can hang onto it, except while wearing it thus, the rubber piece quite often falls off. I have picked up this little piece of rubber that is supposed to go into my ear, off of numerous places. Once it falls if you are not somewhere with some cleanser, you really don't want to put it back -into- your ear again.It is a great device, but wonderfully frustrating as well. It is extremely light, makes for a lot of cool comments, and is a pleasure to use. I had no problem pairing it with 4 different phones and my laptop. It sounds good in the wind, and doesn't give a headache when you wear it for long periods of time. I could put it on in the a.m. and forget it's even there all day. Volume lower button has redial, so you end up having to raise volume after redialing.It takes some getting used to in order to put it into your ear. I suggest putting middle finger on top corner of the USB input, index on the rubber tip, and thumb on the mike end. I would recommend getting a pouch or holster to keep it safe when not in use.Would I buy it again? ProbablyWould I recommend it to others? If you want something cool and interesting, this is it.

review/text: Overall, my experience with this headset is positive. The sound is completely missing low frequencies, but you get used to that and voice clarity does not suffer.Fit is very comfortable, once you rotate the rubber stub to just the right angle (different angles for different ears). I've found that 2 o'clock direction of the stub, with headset pointing at 6, works best for me.I had to exchange the first headset I'd received from Amazon, because it would constantly disconnect, but replacement arrived within a couple of days, so the whole process was very smooth and painless.

review/text: This was my first attempt with a Bluetooth headset and I came away with the "just not right for me" impression. The AX2 is very small, but sound quality is generally good, with one exception. While I could hear callers just fine, it was next to impossible for me to hear the verbal commands from the phone. I also had a hard time operating the volume buttons. The only way to change volume was to take the headset from the ear. Overall, not a bad headset, just was not the one for me.

review/text: For those who wear glasses, this is the best!(Try to avoid ANY headset with hooks if you wear glasses no matter what other people say, IT WILL NO FIT and HURT your ears)For those who don't wear glasses, it is 4 out of 5 stars due to the fact that the sound quality is not as good as Samsung's WEP200. (not sure about other "hookless" headset)Battery Life, full charge, at least 4+ hours continuous talk time (I tested it personally)It weights like nothing to your ear.I had hard time to fit WEP200 on my ear, but AX2 is a snuggle fit. For half the price of WEP200, I will buy AX2.If you outside of the network and have no reception, the headset will do a "beep beep" signal for you, it will keep doing it until your phone get back the reception. Some people found it annoying, some people think this is a useful feature.Pro: Cheap, Tight Fit, VERY Light weight, BEST for people who wear glasses.Con: Okay sound quality, very loud wind noise @ outdoor (on the listener side).One more notice, for people who are going to get it, PLEASE read the instruction included carefully before you try to wear it. That plastic sticking out DOES NOT GOES INTO YOUR EAR CANAL. It sits within the grove inside of the external ear to secure the ear piece. So don't poke yourself to deaf with that.

review/text: I absolutely ADORE this headset. It fits snugly in your ear without being uncomfortable, stays in place, sounds great, battery life is fine for normal use all day long. It took the tiniest bit of work to figure out the thingy that curls up inside your ear. Although it looks like it would be extremely uncomfortable, you can't even feel it in there. There's nothing to wrap around the outside of your ear, so it doesn't bind and it doesn't interfere with glasses or sunglasses. It's so light it just floats there.So why 3 stars? My first one, the Bluespoon AX, lasted about a month then overheated while charging and wouldn't stay on anymore. But, I loved it SOOOOOO much, I went out and bought a second one, this time the AX2. It lasted about 2 weeks and did exactly the same thing.Why, oh why, did they finally make a headset that truly fits in my life, and make it so poorly that it won't keep working??????

review/text: I've had my AX2 now for about two weeks. So far, I really like it for it's size and weight. It's small enough so that I don't look like the Borg (Star Trek) when wearing it, and I don't feel any weight on my ear. I got used to the "antenna" used to hold it in place almost immediately. But unfortunately, the sound quality could be better. The speaker inside the earpiece delivers a lot of treble with little bass. Inside this seems to be okay, but outside I've had to ask my girlfriend to repeat statements a lot. If you plan to use the AX2 indoors, I'd definitely recommend it. But if you're looking for a bluetooth headset for outdoors, I might consider looking at other brands with better overall sound quality.

review/text: Don't let the picture fool you, this headset does not have an weird space age antenna. It is actually a really cool device to keep the headset in your ear without having the big bulky over the ear rubber piece that is supposedly one size fits all. The AX2's funny looking earpiece is ajustable and can be cut to fit almost any ear. As far as the quality, are their better headsets out there... Yes, but are there better headsets out there for the money, I don't think so. I put a strong buy on this BT headset.

Sound quality is excellent and it is the only one I can effectively use in the car on the highway, others are just not loud enough. A tip I would offer is to not leave it in your car, the cold weather killed the battery and not I am left with a, very light, paper weight. Replacement batteries are $20.

review/text: Pros:Pairing was easy. The thing does work, and is usable as an entry-level Bluetooth headset. Loved the mechanism by which it fits in your ear; that's very comfortable and secure at the same time.Cons:You pretty much get what you pay for. It looks nice, but it feels flimsy. When you plug the charger in, it feels like it doesn't fit, or you're putting it in wrong. That isn't a big problem, but it feels like a symptom of a cheaply made product.The performance of the AX2 I received was such that I thought it was defective and I sent it back for an exchange. It seemed like the connection between the headset and the phone was almost always plagued with bad static, the connection was dropped quite often, and people I spoke to while using the headset often complained that they could barely hear me.However, the replacement unit Amazon sent me (kudos to their return process and customer service, by the way) behaved exactly the same way, which tells me that this is just how this model is.In the end, I returned it and bought the just-released Plantronics Discovery 665, with AudioIQ (Amazon sells this, too, but I bought mine from Sprint). The difference is night and day. Of course, the Plantronics also costs several times as much, so it had darn well better perform.Overall, I'd say the AX2 is an okay deal if you buy it at Amazon's discounted price (do not go pay retail for this thing, it isn't nearly worth it and there are dozens of better models at the same price point), and you're only a casual user of the thing. I mean, for the most part it *does* work - just not particularly well.

review/text: I have had NO problems hearing or being heard with the Bluespoon. I love that it is so small and not very noticable. I also wear glasses quite a bit so I like that it doesn't go over the outside of the ear like a lot of them do. But probably the best thing about this little gadget was the price! $20 after rebate! can't beat that anywhere. If you have trouble with the rubber piece (that looks like an antena) that holds in your ear, just be patient and adjust it different angles until it's comfortable. I'm so used to it now, I hardly notice it and it doesn't bother me at all. Everyone that sees mine wants one!

review/text: This little dandy was quite a suprize in ease of use and performance.Pros:Very light. It doesn't have a AAA battery, but a coin one. This makes it extremely light, so it does not become irritating to the ear over time. Controls are easy to use. Because it does not hook over the outside of the ear, you can actually forget you have it on. I can still hear outside noises with it on, so I can conentrate on driving. Reception is very clear. It's smaller size keeps you from looking like one of those 'Star Trek Borg' people I see so many of out there. This was one of the cheapest Bluetooth headsets out there so I was worried about real-world quality, but this out performs many headsets approaching $100+.Cons:That little pointy thing coming out of the top, I originally thought was an antenna. It isn't. It's a soft rubber flexible fitting for inside the ear, and the long part actually curves around the inside fold of the ear and allows the unit to stay in place in your ear without the need to have a hook around the outside of the ear. At first I was dissapointed, but once I figured out it's intent, I was amazed at the ingenuity of it. Now its the best unit I have seen. Buy it. It's worth it.

review/text: Let's start with the product's biggest advantage: for $37 (shipping & taxes), you've got a bona fide bluetooth headset. For those of you who wear glasses (like me) you'll appreciate how this fits into your ear and doesn't battle with your glasses for the space above your ear. It didn't seem stable at first, but when I went for a jog, it stayed in there nice and snug.On the downside, it picks up most of the ambient noise from your surroundings, so conversations outside, doing any activity, or in a mildly noisy room will be difficult, at best. If you're just looking to stay legal while driving; however, this is a good option. Just make sure to turn off your radio, first.Bottom line: if you're a serious techie, looking for a bluetooth that will allow you to place calls while under water (and yes, they do make a model that boasts that), this isn't for you. If you're looking to see what the bluetooth is all about and aren't planning on using it extensively, this is a great bargain.

review/text: I paid [a dollar amount over twice what Amazon's charging, but that they'll delete if I put it here] for one at [a store the name of which Amazon will delete, but if you had a battery club card when you were a kid like I did, you've been there] when they were pretty much the only place to get one. Over the years I've tried headsets from AT&T;, Body Glove, Hello Direct, Jabra, and Plantronics, and I find the Bluespoon's soft spring to be the most secure and most comfortable method of fitting a headset to my ear (for that matter, Jabra headsets won't stay in my ear for more than seconds at a time, and Plantronics makes the most hideously uncomfortable earpieces on Earth).The soft spring does take a bit of getting used to, but that's true of anything that goes in your ear (and also somewhat true of the over-the-ear headsets as well). A good rule of thumb is to wear it for no more than half an hour the first day, and gradually increase the amount of time you wear it each day. It weighs so little that you really don't notice it after you've acclimated to having it IN your ear, not just ON it.Once you've learned how to insert it, the process is quick and one-handed. I don't have any issues with inadvertent button presses (thumb behind the bottom button, middle finger at the tip, and index finger popping the spring into the curve of my ear). And once you've inserted it properly, it's plenty loud. I have to assume that people who say it isn't loud enough just haven't figured out how to insert it.I had trouble with it disconnecting repeatedly from my phone even though it had a full charge, and it turned out that the Bluetooth connection in the phone had actually gone bad. The headset connected just fine to my computer, and the computer couldn't maintain a connection to the phone either. Once I got the phone replaced that problem went away. So if you have connection problems, test the headset with another phone before you throw it away in disgust. It might just be your phone.I bought a second one from Amazon because one of the buttons on my first one didn't survive the impact with the ground after the headset was knocked out of my ear -- I could turn the volume up, but not down. I've repaired that with my trusty soldering iron so now I have two that work. I've also bought one as a gift and recommended it to a friend who's very happy with his.Pluses: extreme battery life; light weight; comfort; Bluetooth 1.2 and handsfree profile support.Minuses: not the highest build quality in the world; replacement springs are nearly impossible to find; if you drop it and the battery is knocked loose, it won't reconnect to your phone until you plug in a power source again; good luck remembering all the button combinations for the handsfree profile.A minus only on paper: no noise reduction. In my experience noise reduction isn't worth the loss of battery power and increase in weight. I'd rather have a lighter headset that goes longer between charges.

review/text: This is my second Bluespoon AX2. The first suffered from a problem I later learned as common to the AX2 - refusal of the unit to charge after several weeks use. The AX2 is sensitive to the length of charge and will ultimately refuse to charge at all if it is not fullt run down to a zero charge and then fully charging it. It appears to also have a delicate power connector. If the supplied power charging connector is pushed all the way (without forcing) it can damage the AX2.The AX2 needs to be managed nd treated more carefully than a consumer device should require (beyond reasonable care).My new unit is starting to show signs of chrging problems (as my firt one did.

My Bluetooth 1.1 Sanyo Katana can't get more than 4 or 5 feet away but inside that and the clearity is great both in and out. Battery life is longer than my phone so that a plus. I really like the little tail thingy on the ear piece because it does a good job of securing the headset to my ear. I rarely have to turn the volume up all the way on the headset, and I don't have to speak loudly for the other end to hear me. The tiny size is awsome!The bad:The multi function button tends to shift and rattle a bit and every time I move my head and hear it, I think "cheap"The flashing blue LED is too bright in the car at night.Wind noise is a problem with this headset.I wouldn't steer anyone away from this headset who is looking for a low priced unit. Would I buy another one? It's possible. :)

review/text: I had this headset for about three weeks before returning it due to frustration. It was electrically defective, so I won't touch on that, but the ergonomics left much to be desired.It's billed as being good for people with glasses due to the little rubber thing that ingeniously tucks inside the curves of your ear. Unfortunately, it was uncomfortable for me, no matter how I trimmed the plastic. It may be comfortable for others, but it is worth noting that I couldn't get it to feel right even after patiently adjusting it for a couple weeks.Another problem is that it is tough to know whether the piece is set correctly in the ear. If it is, the audio is nice and loud. If it isn't, the sound is barely audible. A device that goes in the ear canal is a double-edged sword in this way. I'd put it on and fiddle with the volume buttons and adjusted them using the beeps produced, but when I answered a call, the headset may have shifted slightly, and the headset required more adjustment.The power button is on the front of the unit and sticks out. On top of that, the button requires very little pressure to activate. This makes it very easy to accidentally turn on if you put it in your pocket. This would be fixed if they designed the button "countersunk" into the unit.I think the idea for securing a headset in this way is good, and I really wanted to like it, but I just couldn't.

review/text: I was very happy with the bluespoon AX2 performance and ergonomics but was disappointed with its durability.The AX2 is incredibly small, light, and comfortable to wear. The sound quality is very good and the battery life is the same or better compared with other headsets. The maximum volume is considerably higher than the Motorola HS850 and Scala headsets I've used.This product has two primary shortcomings: Wind noise and durability. I've used several bluetooth headsets and the AX2 is the first one that ever broke from normal use. The charging interface eventually wore-out, and I had to wiggle the AC adapter and keep pressure on it to establish a good connection after only 4 months of use. The buttons also became loose over time and lost some sensitivity, and the battery began to lose its ability to maintain a charge after 4-5 months (although this may have been related to the charging port problems).Outdoors under light winds, listeners often complained that they could hear A LOT of noise. I had considerably more wind noise problems with this head-set than I had with the Moto HS850 and Scala models.I'm tempted to buy another one because it was so small and comfortable...

review/text: AX2 is very unnoticeable and comfortable when you wear it. It is very fragile. It has slipped out of my ear several times. Once dropped you must put it back on the charge for it to work again. A negative of the product is the rubber piece insert snapping off the back. Once it is gone, there is no way to connect the bluetooth to your ear. It only comes with two rubber pieces and you can not reorder the part. It does come with two chargers which is a plus. However, over charging the battery can cause it not to work. Overall, I like it and it works for me.

review/text: After reading the reviews on here in December (there were only about 15-20 at that time), I decided that even though this probably wouldn't be the best Bluetooth Headset on the market, it might be the best for the price. It had mostly good reviews at that time.So I bought it. I was so excited! I loved that it didn't have the over-the-ear thing 'cause I hate those things! Well, it seemed good at first - great functions, loved the way it fit with the rubber tail, extremely light.... BUT then I actually started using it - Once I made some adjustments to the rubber ear plug, I could hear people on the other end just fine, but the problem is that they always seemed to complain of getting bad feedback or me sounding like I was in a tunnel. So I always end up taking it off Bluetooth and just using the phone after about 5 minutes 'cause my friends can't stand it.Oh well. I guess the moral to this lesson is this... Bluetooth is still a fairly new technology with a lot of room for improvement, and at this point the only way to get a really great Bluetooth headset is to pay the big bucks ($75+) for one with the latest greatest best technology. If you're like me and you can't afford to do that, then you're probalby best off waiting until the technology improves and prices come down, because, yeah, I got this headset at a great price, but since it's worthless, I'd have been better off spending that money on something I could actually use (like groceries - hehe).

review/text: I just received my headset and it synced immediately with my Treo 650. Sound quality was great for the most part, and my caller's could hear me clearly. The small size is great.It was hard to get in my ear the first time, but once I got it in once, it was easy thereafter. Also the signal broke up a bit when I had my phone in my trouser pocket. I think the range is a bit short on the unit, but it wasn't too bad.

review/text: I have purchased several bluetooth headsets in my attempt to obtain a good quality sound. I purchased the Nextlink AX2 with the hopes of solving my search. I was not impressed. It was loud enough (as they stated), but with the volume turned up it created an echo for the recipient of the call. It is a ROYAL pain trying to get the thing in your ear while driving. Once in, it was fine. I hung up on several calls while attempting to secure it in my ear.I have put the whole thing back in the package and will try to return (though for the $30 less shipping both ways) it probably isn't worth my time.I have gone to the expensive H700 MotorolaAs they say -"you get what you pay for"

review/text: this headset kicks! i dont even want to call it a 'headset', cuz it's waay too small for that.it's available online for about 20 US bucks, and it's worth 10 times that, easily.after using a Jabra BT200 with my newy aquired motorola L2, i wanted something smaller, so i found this little nugget. the Jabra worked quite well, mind you, but was a little too big of a gizmo than i wanted to sling up off the top side of my ear.the bluespoon AX2 is unbelieveable. it felt, literally, like it wasn't there. it communicated (bluetoothed) to my phone seamlessly. it communicated to me (thru some beeps and chirps) flawlessly.it took about three days of heavy use to get the 'set comfy in my ear, yet comfy or not it was always very secure and clear, both incoming and outgoing. it sicks in your via one of two (lg or sm)"soft springs" which are just soft rubber thingys that follow the inner contours of your ear.(this thing held on even when my own glasses fell off my head!) (thanks, slayer!)i've read about some charging problems in some other posts, and i hate to report that i'm having some charging problems myself. seems the mini-usb connection is not very solid, maybe due to the fact that the thing is made of lightweight plastic.the only problem i see with this unit is the blinky-blue light. it blinks once every 10 seconds when it's on. it blinks alot more when you're on the line. blinking when you're on the phone is acceptable, even expected, but you should be able to turn it off, so as not to freak out the general public. (not everybody knows what a borg is..)so if you're looking for a cheap, light, comfortable, reliable, geeky, borg-like headset that's worth every penny, get a freakin sweet bluespoon ax2 beeootch!

review/text: Here's what I like about the headset:1. Extremely lightweight, with secure fit. It's easy to forget you have this on because it is so light. The soft spring easily fits into your ear and secures it. With the hook type headsets, there is some play during side-to-side head movement. This fits snugly in the ear and normal movements do not feel loose or unsecured. You do notice the speaker piece after it's been in your ear for more than a few hours, but it's not painful, just a little sore as there is only one size. I generally don't keep the headset in all day anyway, and only realized it because I had forgotten it was in.2. Incoming sound is very loud. It's in-ear design and fit allows you to hear very well. It's one headset I've used that I actually don't want at full volume.3. Has lots of ways to connect and conference calls. You can control switching from headset to handset from the headset, or connecting more than one call through the buttons.4. The blue talk light turns red when the battery is low, giving you a visual warning.Not so great:1. Lots of static in the bluetooth connection. I have my cellphone on my belt clipped on the left, and use the headset on the right ear. I do tend to notice this more when I am near a wifi source, but not always. I've also noticed it away from wifi signals (like my car). I've had the headset for about a week, and am still trying to figure out why a 3' distance on a 30' BT device would have so much problem with a clear connection.2. While the volume is loud, the sound quality is poor. My Motorola H500 wasn't nearly as loud, so I can't hear well when it's noisy, but the sound quality is much better. The AX2 sounds like midrange frequencies are boosted. While it may make voices easier to hear, it also sounds tinny and unnatural.3. Build quality is very mediocre. It's plastic, and I dropped it from waist level onto the parking lot surface. One of the volume buttons popped off, and the battery compartment was half popped out, as well as the plastic halves loosened. So now I don't have a volume button. I'd heard others say this unit breaks easily, and I can believe it might not have survived a drop from ear level.4. Headset tends to echo, although I don't know if it's worse than other BT sets. My Motorola echoed, but not quite as much as this. I don't notice it, but the person I call will mention it.5. The first day the power on/off tone was clearly audible. I don't know what happened, but after the first day the tone is muted so much I have to listen closely to hear the unit power on or off.I am still on the hunt for my ideal bluetooth set. Will try out the noise cancelling mics or bone conduction technology next because the older mic technology this represents leaves much to be desired.

review/text: i had originally bought the motorola hs820. i was using it with a moto krzr. i don't know if my particular headset was faulty, but the sound quality was horrendous. everything sounded tinny and even synthesized. someone told me that bluetooth just doesn't sound right with a moto phone. i returned that and bought this headset anyway (it's so cheap and amazon returns are very simple, that i decided to give it another go). i was shocked when i saw how small it is (you don't realize just from the pictures). it's incredibly comfortable in my ear, and the sound quality is just as it is from the phone. no difference at all, and people on the other end don't notice i'm using a headset. i recommend buying this over any others. it's definitely worth it!

review/text: When I first bought this headset in April 2006, it was amazing. It held up to all the hype, and I love how small it is. Within a month, however, it started having volume issues; nothing major, but when I would answer a call, it would start out on low volume. Easily fixed by increasing the volume on the phone or headset, but it would do this on every call, no matter how high the volume was set for the previous call. Two months ago I also started experiencing the charging issues described by others. When it was charging correctly, it would charge from completely dead to full in 2 hours; however, now it won't charge for more than 30 minutes, and battery life is abysmal. I have to charge it everyday, and even then it doesn't achieve near its original 8 hour talktime. I still give it 3 stars, because when it worked it was an excellent headset, and still is for the approx 2 hours a day I can use it. I'm thinking about trying the new Samsung WEP200, as it's a similar small, in-ear design, which is one of the best features of this headset.

review/text: I had this headset for 3 days. Dropped it from waist level and now it doesn't work. I could have gotten better use out of $30 by purchasing a fairly decent bottle of wine...it would be gone too, but I would have had more enjoyment out of it. This unit is very small, and getting it into the ear is awkward, and is impossible to do without pressing one of the volume up/down buttons, which means you will have to re-adjust. If you have larger hands, like I do, it is a little odd to handle...hence, the greater possibility of it being dropped. The sound was mediocre at best, and everyone I spoke to (in the short 3 days that it did work) said there was an echo on their end. Not recommended. Move on to another.

review/text: This BT headset is relatively small and unobtrusive compared to others I've seen. It is easy to use, the sound quality is acceptable and it fit my ear comfortably. After getting it, however, I realized that I really wasn't in love with the whole BT earpiece fad (people walking around, apparently talking to themselves, with a big plastic wart hanging out of their ear) - so I rarely use it. The only real complaint I can muster is that it is somewhat sensitive to wind noise and best used indoors or an enclosed area. If you have abnormal ears - it might not fit as well for you.

product/title: BoxWave Palm TX Armor Case - The Metal Case, Heavy Duty Protective Case (Black)
review/text: This is the second Armour Case I have bought for a Palm PDA; prior to this I had used the Palm brand had cases. Unfortunately, this will probably be the last Armour Case I purchase, not because of the case but because the Palm PDA's are no longer being made. Having said that, I would get it again in a minute if I had a need: it is easy to open but does not open by itself the way the Palm-made hard cases I have used do. It has the right cut-outs in the right places meaning I can plug it into the computer or the power cord while still in the case (unlike the Palm-made hard case, where you have to almost remove the unit to access these slots). Having TWO Palm PDA's stolen in the last year (Note to thieves: these are NOT phones, guys!), I was lucky to still be able to get a Palm replacement as well as another one of these cases. But, I doubt I'll be able to get another Palm PDA if it happens again, which is unfortunate.

review/text: I've used this case for over a year now. I carry my palm all the time in my jeans pocket, it goes everywhere with me. I've even dropped it a few times.The catch that holds it closed works well, not hard to open (though with two hands). If I stick too many receipts in the back of the case the catch won't catch.Possible downside? The hinge opens along the long side like a book, so if you use it oriented that way the case kinda gets in the way. If you use it turned the other way (my preference) the case sits nicely in my hand for writing-awesome.Never used the belt clip, I've had terrible luck with those things no matter what they're attached to (phone, ipod, whatever..)

review/text: When I got my new Palm TX, I knew I wanted a hard metal case. I had one for my T3 that was really ugly and had gaping seams that were grossly misaligned. But it protected my Palm from all the drops and abuse I could give it. So after reading the other reviews on this page, I didn't expect much more than protection.The case I got shipped to me is really well made. The seams are tight and straight, the device is held securely, the latch is secure without being inoperable, and access is available open or closed to the stylus, card, headphone jack, power and hotsync jacks. The heft, color and texture are pleasing, at least to me. I don't use the belt clip so I can't comment on its functionality. Although I bought this case as a temporary solution until I could identify something better, I don't know what would make a case better for me than this one.

review/text: One would think that the makers of a PDA would have the accessories for the PDA down pat, but I wasn't impressed with the Palm case I saw in person. This case as so many advantages to the Palm case that it's hard to list, but here's the highlights:*Palm case only comes in silver-ish and looks pretty tacky vs. this case comes in black.*Palm case and many others are not snug with the PDA, so it will rattle (not with this case).*The slip tab inside the case helps keep the PDA secure, so even if the case pops open, the PDA won't go flying.*Very secure latch. (I have a bit of trouble getting the case open, but I have bad nerves in my hands.)*Cutouts for everything (SD card, headphone jack, power button, etc.)*The cutout area for the headphone jack is actually big enough and doesn't impede the jack.*TWO SD card slots on the inside cover.*Soft inside lining.*Doesn't add too much bulk to PDA.About the only drawback I can see with this case is that the belt clip might as well not be included and is a piece of junk, but that seems to be the case with other Palm TX cases and I wasn't planning on using it anyway.Update Feb. 2009: I've had this case for nearly 2.5 years, so I got quite a bit of use out of it. Unfortunately, during a short drop, the peg holding the PDA into the case broke. The case protected the PDA perfectly, and it's still technically useable. The PDA just now doesn't stay in the case when it's open. I haven't found a replacement peg piece, so I'm going to have to buy an entire new hard case to protect my PDA and keep it in the case. I'm weighing the two options.

review/text: I have had this case for about 7 months and I am satisfied with its performance. It is well built and has protected my TX from damage. The Palm fits snugly and the case closes securely. The memory card slots are a nice touch, and the openings allow for access to all ports without opening the case.I can't comment on the sturdiness of the belt clip. I took it off the first day, as I usually carry my Palm in my shirt pocket.Cons: The case is very slippery so I stuck on some 3M non-skid strips to keep it from slipping out of my hand.I also wish the front cover opened and folded over the back, rather than just over 180 degrees.You have to watch the hinge pin, as it has a tendency to work its way out.I consider these to be minor shortcomings and I would recommend this case.

review/text: I purchased this case based on the reviews here, and on my own prior bad experience with a Palm case. This case looks neat, has cutouts so you can use all the ports and plugs with the case closed, and has a neoprene lining that fits very nicely. The SD slots have a much nicer design than Palm's. The minus to Boxwave's design is that it does not fold back flat against itself; the cover just flops at 180 and I can see that being a problem. Also, the hinge and clasp are external, taking up more space. The belt clip, which I would never use anyway, looks like an afterthought that would easily snap under any substantial force.

review/text: This is my second metal TX case (the other one was a different brand). I did my research before buying it and was accidentally shipped the wrong case. So I got to see what another case was like and I have a much greater appreciation for this one.Let me tell you, this one is excellent. I do not and will not use the belt clip, so I cannot vouch for that portion. Due to the excellent padding and fit, My PDA is very snuggly settled in the case. The case allows access to all of the TX features. It is very sturdy, protective, and adds very little bulk or weight to the PDA. The case will easily open if you are trying to open it, otherwise it stays closed. The case also has four tiny points on the bottom of it that will raise the case off the surface, so that if you are playing music, you can hear it with the speaker side down to the surface. It even has a tiny access hole to the reset button.I highly recommend it if you are scared of ever dropping your PDA or simply just want to protect you delicate, yet fairly expensive piece of equipment.

review/text: This simple matt black case is tough and the TX fits in it snugly. Its well designed to access ports without removing it from the case. I had a leather case for my last palm. It looked a bit more stylish but because it was soft it was always pressing on the command buttons and turning itself on. No such problem with this shell case. The only design improvement I would suggest would be a slightly rubberized exterior like I have on my motorola cell phone. It really helps me to keep from dropping it. The metal case is a bit slippery. I'm happy with it.

review/text: I purchased this after having a cracked screen on my TX, and paying a bundle for repairs. The little screen cover was on it, and covering the screen. Apparently having the side of the TX pinched caused the screen to get broken even while closed. After I'd sent it off for repairs I immediately went shopping and found this case. Exactly what a paranoid palm owner would want.The case looks pretty nice, though it does add some bulk. That is pretty unavoidable. All the ports are very accessable, and even the speaker is accounted for. I'm pretty happy with the fit. The edges are a little on the sharp side on some corners. It snaps closed nicely, and seems pretty snug. The hinge juts out a bit after closing, and I can see the pin might start to work out over time. The SD cards have to be inserted backwards, such that the metal contacts face you, or it will push out the card holder, which will then make contact with the screen. My final gripe is the most annoying.. as noted by other reviewers, you can only lay the case open, like a book. You cannot fold it back, behind the palm, out of the way.All in all I'm pretty happy, and haven't seen anything better. It looks like it will work well. I just see room for improvement.

The cheap plastic slide piece that attaches the PDA to the case would break in a stiff breeze. The neoprene lining lifts off in humid weather or whenever it feels like it.

review/text: The case is attractive, built like a tank, and the Palm TX fits easily and snugly inside. Though reasonably slim, naturally it does take up more space in your pocket. Since it's hinged like a book, you end up holding it like one- on your lap or a table. You can't leave it in the case if you use an after market cradle to charge/synch your Palm TX. Though the original Palm TX cover is rather skimpy, think of it as a bikini i.e. comfortable & covers the basics. The Armor case might be better for travel and rough environments.

I use my Palm in my pants pockets, and I like the fact that it does not get scratches at all, like the Palm original aluminum case. It does not rattle the Palm because it fits snuggly, unlike the original case. It has a back opening for the tiny speaker, so I think you can hear alarms louder. I've used mine for a month and I haven't have any problem with the plastic hinges that others described. It is somewhat difficult to open, though, that's why I give it 4 stars. You can charge and synch the Palm without open this case, unlike the original one. I do recommend it.

The springing thing won't hold it very well any more. The other day I got home from work and it was almost dark so I had to hurry and do some snowblowing. I heard a bump sound and didn't realize my Palm fell off the belt clip. I ran over it with my snowblower and it came out the shoot and hit the wall. I didn't realize it until I dug it out of the snow two days later. The TX was gaping open and the stylus was broken in half. I snapped it closed and the TX still works fine! Just had to get a new stylus. Weird, because my first TX died on me with no bumping around and I got this replacement one under warranty.

The problem lies with the plastic slide where you attach your Palm. It is flimsy and not detailed properly re. interface with the metal case itself. It invariably breaks after several openings/closings, if not before. I had a Rhino case before on another Palm and it looks as if I will have to try that or a leather one again.

Looks like there is enough clearance so cards will not press onto Palm's screen but I haven't tested that.

review/text: The case design is awesome, but steer clear of the metallic version. It scratches easily. Now I've got the black version and LOVE it. I like how the case protects my entire Palm TX. Not one corner of my TX extends beyond the case so if I ever drop it, it may be jostled, but not totally destroyed. The cut outs give you ample room to work with when turning it off or on and using cords, memory cards, or the stylus. There's even a little cut-out in the back for the speaker. The case latch is solid and doesn't pop open. Inside, there's a soft felt lining and slots for 2 memory cards. I don't use the belt clip, so this case is just fine for me and the price is right too.

review/text: Their DEFECTIVE product caused my palm tx to BREAK! I used the armor case and the belt clip that came with it the very day I got the package. My palm fell on the ground! Turns out the screw at the back of the armor case which was attatched to the belt clip was loose. Now my palm is broken. I emailed boxwave and this is the reply I got: "Our liability policy prevents us from providing additional compensation for it. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you."- All they offered was to replace the DEFECTIVE armor case with another one. As if I would ever trust their product again!!!

review/text: I wish I could give this 0 stars. I got this for my Palm TX, but as another reviewer experienced, the damn case wouldn't close!! The screw on the back doesn't seem very stable either. I just sent BoxWave an email complaining about this and demanding all of my money back, including shipping charges. What a crappy product. I think I'm going to try the Rhinoskin one instead.

review/text: Protection was my intention but I ended up carrying a brick in my pocket! It was easier to just carry the Palm TX without the cover. This was more of obstacle than protection.

review/text: I was looking at this case for a long time and now I have it in my hands. It is pretty much what I wanted for a Palm case to be. It is sturdy, has nice padding and fits my Palm just perfect. It might feel slippery a bit as someone admitted before but I don't find it that much. And yes, SD card holder is very handy. Belt clip is bit bulky but serves its purpose when you need it. Otherwise just disconnect it. So in short it is just what I wanted.

review/text: Very sturdy case. I have a little difficulty opening the case without moving the palm pilot upwards. Also not easy to open latch. But the sleek design fits well inside pocket or purse. Opening at bottom is perfect access for charging the device.

review/text: I really love this case, it is very nice looking and it keeps my TX nice and secure. The TX is easy to insert into the case and I also love the slot for carrying an SD card in the front of the case. I do not use the belt clip, so I cannot comment on that, but the case is wonderful.

review/text: This is a very good protective case. I like the belt clip attachment with easy access to remove. Although the button broke on the back of the hard shell case to the belt attachment. Is it possible by just buy the button for the back of the case?

review/text: I love this case. It is very hard to keep my palm protected. I carry my palm in my pocket everyday at work. Befor this case sometimes my lab jacket would get caught in the car door and the door would get slamed on my palm. This case prevents any damage. I LOVE IT!

review/text: The aluminum case was disappointing. It looks like black plastic. Two of us struggled and struggled to get the Palm TX to fit in the case. After repeated attempts, we gave up and I e-mailed Boxwave. Finally after reading someone else's review, I realized that the funny piece in the middle of the case was supposed to slide into the TX. It worked fine after that. The box was labeled for the Palm Tungsten, not the TX. Simple instructions with the case, would've saved me a couple of hours of fiddling and e-mails. I agree with another reviewer who said the case is slippery also. I probably would not buy this again, but will keep it now that I have it.

review/text: A necessity for all clumpsy people who drop everything.The screw on the back of the case needs to be tightned properly, but besides that. It is definately worth the money to protect your pda.

review/text: I bought the silver version of this case and was very disapointed. The belt clip is of such cheap construction that the case would easily fall off my belt. On the bright side, it protected my Palm from breaking, but I would have preferred it not to fall in the first place. The case also had a tendency to flip open while on my belt, causing the whole thing to pivot on its flimsy clip. I don't recommend this product.

review/text: The metal is sturdy and the openings are perfect for maximum functionality in all the features of the PDA. I previously had a hard case made by Palm, which was a nice product, but I wasn't able to keep the unit protected and use the MP3 function.

review/text: functions exactly as stated in product description. i searched extensively online for similar cases and chose this one based on other reviews and price. no major complaints; however it can slide across smooth surfaces. i placed some sticky pads (available at most hardware stores) to prevent accidental slipping. otherwise, this case is highly recommended!

review/text: I just got the newest version of the Palm TX--and I'm not sure if they've changed the dimensions or anything--but this case does not close when I put my Palm TX in it. That's right, it doesn't work with the new TX. There is a small piece of plastic that is supposed to keep the palm in the case, but this is preventing the case from closing because the palm is too large.FYI. I will probably keep the product and just break off the little piece of plastic. But just so you know, don't buy this hardcase if you're getting a NEW Palm TX (with wi-fi and such).
